“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **chai**

 [chai](https://github.com/agoragames/chai) provides a very easy to use api for mocking/stubbing your python objects, patterned after the [Mocha](http://mocha.rubyforge.org/) library for Ruby. This past week saw 0.3.5 and subsequently 0.3.6 releases. We fixed only closing a non-matching expectation if its counts have been met as well as fixing the logic of raising UnexpectedCall when calling a stub and an unclosed, non-matching, in-order expectation does not have its counts met (got all that?).

 **factory_worker**

 [factory-worker](https://github.com/agoragames/factory-worker) is a node.js library that creates the Factory pattern for object stores. We integrated a [patch to provide a clearer error when a parent is not defined](https://github.com/agoragames/factory-worker/pull/6). We'll get a formal release out shortly.

 **haigha**

 [haigha](https://github.com/agoragames/haigha) is our simple to use client library for interacting with AMQP brokers. In the 0.5.10 release, we fixed an unexpected indent error. Thanks to Chris Erway for [pointing that out to us](https://github.com/agoragames/haigha/pull/29#discussion_r4605967).
