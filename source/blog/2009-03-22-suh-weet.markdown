One of our engineers has been doing some work with RRDTool (Round Robin Database); and more specifically PYRRD.  He's using it to combine real time usage stats with a prediction algorithm so that we can pre-emptively allocate resources to different parts of the system.  Its real spiffy.

 His additions to the PYRRD library just got commited to the trunk build, and he's credited in the readme.
