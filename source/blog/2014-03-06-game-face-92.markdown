"Game Face" will be our (mostly) weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

**haigha**

[haigha](https://github.com/agoragames/haigha) is our simple to use client library for interacting with AMQP brokers. In 0.7.3, we added IPv6 support.

**leaderboard**

[leaderboard](https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard/) allows you to build leaderboards using Redis. The [leaderboard](https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard) and [leaderboard-python](https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-python) libraries all saw updates this past week. We added a global member data option that allows multiple leaderboards to share the same set of member data as well as a helper method to retrieve a top # of players.
