Do you use points or do you use pixels? I've fallen in love with points. If you know me, you might already know this because I talk about them all the time. So what is it that I like about points, or perhaps, what is it that I dislike about pixels?



 First off, did you know that a pixel isn't actually a pixel? As it turns out, what we refer to as a pixel nowadays, is more accurately defined as a device independent pixel, also known as a kludge. Consider this, you’re a developer, 10 years back, listening to bootylicious while styling with your bowl haircut. You’re probably specifying things in pixels with the assumption that monitors will never have more than the cutting edge 96ppi. Now fast-forward to present day with our 400 some odd pixel iPhone displays and consider how compressed that same page looks. Displays may be increasing in resolution, but our eyes aren’t. Additionally, we can't let our pixel-based designs shrink as resolution increases, so we what do we do? We redefine the pixel to the critical measure of 1/96 of an inch.

 Interestingly enough, this measure does have magical properties of it's own. However, it’s a system that seems to be rooted in happenstance, so I feel a little dirty about using it without considering anything more. The point system, on the other hand, not only doesn't suffer from this shameful introduction, but hell, there's elegance in its history.

 The point (pt) goes way back and has a helpful cousin, the pica, with its own special abilities. So why do you think those crazy typesetters and print practitioners choose the point and the pica even to this day? I would certainly propose flexibility as the reason. 1 pixel is equivalent to 1/96 of an inch, what the hell does that mean? Now, consider 1/72 of an inch and we're getting into the territory where I might actually recognize the difference of a single unit. We're all familiar with 12pt font, there's also 11, 10, 9, and 8. It’s simple enough, pick a font above 7 and you’ll be able to read it. What about 32pt? That's headline font in the print world. Guess what, there's no reason why it can't be used in the web world as well. It's just that we realize we're moving bits around and not ink, so we use relative measures such as the em for fonts, but it should all still be rooted in the friendly point.

 So what's a pica? Well a pica is 1/6 of an inch. 6, huh, well that's a nice number. Half of that is 3. I like 3. Get this, if there's 6 pica in an inch and there's 72 points in an inch, then that means there's 12 points in pica. 12, now that's an awesome number. It's evenly divisible by 2, 3, and 4. How many numbers can you say that about? I'm sure the answer is infinite, but now you’re just being a jerk and you’re missing my point. 12 is cool, 6 is cool, 3 is cool, 1.5 is cool, .75 is cool even .375 is manageable. Let's go the other way. 24 = 2pc, 48 = 4pc, 96 = 8pc. There's that damn number again.

 Anyway, what's my point? (No pun intended) Use points. They're there and they're not fugly. Converting pixels into points is easy, just multiply by .75. Also, since it’s rooted in what's made print look good for years rather then what the state of the art was when CSS became popular, the numbers just tend to work out nicer. Give em a try (haha, another pun); what do you have to lose?
