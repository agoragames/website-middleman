“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **bracket_tree**

 [bracket_tree](https://github.com/agoragames/bracket_tree) is a bracketing system built around the BracketTree Data Specification, which uses a three-section data structure built on top of JSON to convey the visual representation, progression logic, and seed mapping in a serializable format. For more information on the data specification, please read the [BracketTree Data Specification](https://github.com/agoragames/bracket_tree/wiki/BracketTree-Data-Specification).

 BracketTree builds upon the specification by providing Ruby classes for programmatically generating templates for brackets and generating brackets from those templates. It also contains a number of common bracket template types like Single Elimination and Double Elimination, with the ability to put your own extensions on their logic and representation.

 **kairos**

 [kairos](https://github.com/agoragames/kairos) provides time series storage using a Redis backend. It's still under development and this week, version 0.0.7 was released which fixes an issue handling an interval without data.

 **oembedr**

 [oembedr](https://github.com/agoragames/oembedr) is our Lightweight, Flexible OEmbed Consumer Library. At least we think it's all those things. This week we [added speakerdeck.com as an OEmbed endpoint](https://github.com/agoragames/oembedr/pull/2). We'll get a new release out soon enough.

 **redis-namespace**

 [redis-namespace](https://github.com/defunkt/redis-namespace) is a gem which can be used to namespace Redis keys. However, the configuration of the current release's gemspec is incompatible with the 3.0.0 release of the [redis](https://github.com/redis/redis-rb) gem. One of our engineers submitted a [pull request to test compatibility under the latest redis gem](https://github.com/defunkt/redis-namespace/pull/39) and the current stable and forthcoming release of the Redis server. And hey, it looks like that pull request was integrated and is available in the redis-namespace 1.2.0 release.

 **streak-python**

 [streak-python](https://github.com/czarneckid/streak-python) is a port of the [streak](https://github.com/czarneckid/streak) Ruby gem, which is a library for calculating win/loss streak using Redis. streak-python is [available on PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/streak) for inclusion as a library in your own Python applications.

 **vines**

 [vines](https://github.com/negativecode/vines) is an XMPP chat server for Ruby. It can use a number of different storage backends such as CouchDB, MongoDB, or Redis, to store its internal data. We've been playing around with [Riak](http://wiki.basho.com/Riak.html) internally and figured this would be a chance to contribute some Riak code back to the community, so a [pull request was opened to add a Riak storage adapter](https://github.com/negativecode/vines/pull/15).
