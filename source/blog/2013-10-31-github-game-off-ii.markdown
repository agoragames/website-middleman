Agora’s David Czarnecki has been invited, for a second year, to judge [GitHub’s Game Off](https://github.com/blog/1674-github-game-off-ii). The web-based game challenge kicks off in November and is loosely based on the theme “change”. Participants are encouraged to use open source libraries, frameworks, graphics, and sounds in their game. Last year, David and his colleague of judges played and rated almost 200 games.

Below is a selection of GitHub’s 2012 Game Off winners. All winning, runner up and honorable mention entries are available to play on [GitHub](https://github.com/blog/1337-github-game-off-winners).
