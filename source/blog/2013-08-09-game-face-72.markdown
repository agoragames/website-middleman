“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **bnet_scraper**

 [bnet_scraper](https://github.com/agoragames/bnet_scraper/) is our Nokogiri-based scraper of Battle.net profiles. We released 0.7.0 and this will most likely be our last release before 1.0.0. We added date formatting support for dd/mm/yyyy formats, a Profile#account method, a scrape method on Profile and League objects for re-scraping these domain models, fixed league scraping via league_id instead of url, adding the clan name and tag to the Profile object and finally a slew of documentation updates with proper usage.

 **haigha**

 [haigha](https://github.com/agoragames/haigha) is our simple to use client library for interacting with AMQP brokers. In the 0.6.0 release, we fixed a bug so that we only accept str, unicode, or bytearray as Message body types.
