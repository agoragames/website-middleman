“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **factory-worker**

 [factory-worker](https://github.com/agoragames/factory-worker) is a node.js library that creates the Factory pattern for object stores. The 0.7.0 release integrates a pull request to [allow inheritance from already-defined models in Factory.create](https://github.com/agoragames/factory-worker/pull/5). We also updated the jessie library as well as cleaning up the npm contact information.

 **tassadar**

 [tassadar](https://github.com/agoragames/tassadar) is our fast Starcraft 2 replay parser written in pure Ruby. We will cut a new release soon, but we integrated a pull request to [remove random <sp/> in player names that have clan tags](https://github.com/agoragames/tassadar/pull/11).
