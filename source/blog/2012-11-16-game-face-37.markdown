“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **CHAP Links Library**

 [CHAP links library](https://github.com/almende/chap-links-library) is a web based visualization library for displaying graphs, networks, and timelines. A pull request was submitted and integrated to [fix a bug where timeline events shift position when updated](https://github.com/almende/chap-links-library/pull/43).

 **leaderboard-python**

 [leaderboard-python](https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-python) is our leaderboard project, originally written in Ruby, ported to Python. The 2.0.0 release of leaderboard-python brings the Python library up to feature party with the Ruby library. Internal code documentation and code samples in the README were also added.

 **spinel**

 [Spinel](https://github.com/cadwallion/spinel) is a new free and open source game engine under development that utilizes [mruby](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/) as its integral scripting layer. Under the hood is C/C++, however wherever possible the engine uses Ruby. It is in _EARLY DEVELOPMENT_. What you see is the result of initial research taken place during an Agora Games Hackathon in 24 hours.

 **sure**

 [sure](https://github.com/gabrielfalcao/sure) is a utility belt for automated testing in python (inspired by [should.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js/)). A pull request was submitted and integrated to [add {X}.should.be.greater_than_or_equal_to(Y) and {Y}.should.be.lower_than_or_equal_to(X) methods](https://github.com/gabrielfalcao/sure/pull/21).

 **timecop**

 [timecop](https://github.com/travisjeffery/timecop) is a gem providing "time travel" and "time freezing" capabilities, making it dead simple to test time-dependent code. A pull request was submitted and integrated to [update the homepage and rubyforge_project values](https://github.com/travisjeffery/timecop/pull/48) in the gemspec. Just tidying up a bit.
