“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **leaderboard**

 [leaderboard](https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard/) allows you to build leaderboards using Redis. Another version 3 feature proposal pull request was added to add a :sort_by option to that would be appropriate for the ranked_in_list call to sort by either score (:score) or rank (:rank) when returning results. This may be useful when you're retrieving a list of ranked friends and would like them sorted in a particular way.
