“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **chai**

 [chai](https://github.com/agoragames/chai) provides a very easy to use api for mocking/stubbing your python objects, patterned after the [Mocha](http://mocha.rubyforge.org/) library for Ruby. As of version 0.4.5, we fixed some issues related to packaging and test running.

 **kairos**

 Kairos provides time series storage using Redis, Mongo or SQL backends. Kairos is intended to replace RRD and Whisper in situations where the scale and flexibility of other data stores is required. With version 0.7.1, we added configuration options for columns in SQL stores as well as adding a Timeseries.delete_all() to delete all stats in a timeseries.
