“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **bnet_scraper**

 [bnet_scraper](https://github.com/agoragames/bnet_scraper/) is our Nokogiri-based scraper of Battle.net profiles. In the 0.4.0 release, a revamped profile scraper API is available in addition to pulling of achievements, match history and league information. Finally, Heart of the Swarm information is now available.

 **leaderboard**** (and leaderboard-python and leaderboard-coffeescript)
 **

 [leaderboard](https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard/) allows you to build leaderboards using Redis. We released version 3.0.2 this past week to fix a data leak in `expire_leaderboard` and `expire_leaderboard_at` to also set expiration on the member data hash. We also fixed this data leak with the 2.2.2 release of [ leaderboard-python](https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-python), our Python port of the leaderboard project. Finally, we released version 1.0.0 of [leaderboard-coffeescript](https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-coffeescript) since it had been at full feature parity with the Ruby and Python implementations since it was started. And don't worry, the data leak was fixed in that project as well.
