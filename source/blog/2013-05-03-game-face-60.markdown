“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **activity_feed**

 [activity_feed](https://github.com/agoragames/activity_feed) is our Ruby gem for storing and managing activity feeds in Redis. The 2.3.0 release adds a check_item?(...) method to see if an item is in an activity feed.

 **homebrew**

 [homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew) is the "missing package manager for OS X". We submitted a pull request that was [integrated for adding Redis 2.6.13 support](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/pull/19574).

 **kairos**

 [kairos](https://github.com/agoragames/kairos) provides time series storage using a Redis backend and, as of 0.2.0, MongoDB. The latest release is a major refactor, and with the new MongoDB backend, supports many more use cases. The 0.2.1 release also includes optimizations for processing multiple transforms on each data set query.
