If you've ever wanted to access your Halo:Reach statistics from Ruby, you can now using the [Halo:Reach Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/halo-reach-api).



 The API methods should be pretty self-explanatory and you can check out the [gem's RDoc online](http://rubydoc.info/gems/halo-reach-api/1.0.0/frames) or look at the [unofficial API method documentation](http://www.haloreachapi.net/wiki/Available_methods) for more information. Maybe the one caveat to getting involved in the project or using the API in general is that you need a Bungie Pro account to generate an API key. This will cost you 750 MS points per year. An 800 MS point pack will cost you $10.

 You can also get involved in the development of the API over on the [Halo:Reach Ruby API GitHub project](https://github.com/agoragames/halo-reach-api).

 You can find more hilarity over on my Twitter account, [CzarneckiD](http://twitter.com/czarneckid).
