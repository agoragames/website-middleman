Steven Flenory, Studio Director at Agora Games, was recently invited to speak at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Steve provided the group of mostly freshman with an overview of the company, Agora’s beginnings and how we got where we are today. By speaking to such groups, Agora hopes to provide firsthand knowledge of the technology and gaming industry, while inspiring young, budding developers and entrepreneurs.

Agora Games was founded in 2005, born from the Incubation Program at RPI. The nation’s first such program, wholly sponsored and operated by a university, is open to all start-up enterprises with a technology-based product or service.
