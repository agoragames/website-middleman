“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **vindicia-api**

 [vindicia-api](https://github.com/agoragames/vindicia-api/) is a wrapper for creating queries to the Vindicia CashBox API. No functional changes in the 0.0.6 release, but we did change an underlying requirement to use the activesupport gem instead of the active_support gem. This was causing issues with bundling in another project where the vindicia-api gem was being used.
