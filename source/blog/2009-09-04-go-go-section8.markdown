title: Go go Section8!
author: Brian Corrigan

We just (as in 10 minutes ago!) launched the statistics portal for [Section8](http://www.joinsection8.com/), a first person shooter by [Timegate](http://www.timegate.com/) and [SouthPeak Games](http://www.southpeakgames.com/region.php).  Go check it out at [http://s8stats.timegate.com](http://s8stats.timegate.com ) and join our clan while we still have a few spots open!

 If you haven't yet played [Section8,](http://www.joinsection8.com/) you owe it to yourself to download the demo on XBOX Live or hit up GameStop for a copy.  The single player action is fun and the multi-player totally rocks.

 Congratulations to both the team at [Timegate](http://www.timegate.com/) our internal project team including:

- Producer - Steven Flenory
- Associate Producer - Mike Jodon
- Lead Engineer - Eric Torrey
