title: 'Nerds: The Take Over'

Several days ago, I was walking with my Agora Games t-shirt, which happens to bare the Major League Gaming (MLG) logo on the arm. Out of Dunkin Donuts, a young boy excitedly ran up to me. After catching his breath, he goes, “excuse me, do you compete in the MLG?” At that point I had gotten towed and was on the phone with the police so I simply shook my head no.

 Think back to high school; remember the assortment of social groups? To name a few, we had the jocks with expectations of college sports and the major leagues. Also, we had the dramatic arts students who hoped for the big break that would land them fame and fortune. There’s no forgetting the music students who dreamed of being rap or rock stars and finally, the nerds. Sadly there was no glamorous expectation for the nerds. They were expected to do your normal jobs, working for big companies or starting their own.

 Even when you considered the earning potential, there was still that essence of glory that was missing, unless you discovered something great. This however, started to change about eight years ago when Sundance started MLG. Today MLG is accurately described as a huge concert for gamers. The last event housed almost 15,000 while streaming to an audience of at least 22.5 million.

 After getting my car, I started thinking of the influence that MLG has on the new generation. To young kids, MLG is right up there with other professional leagues such as the NBA or the NFL. MLG already opens doors to huge opportunities for sponsorships and endorsement deals and will only go further. Additionally, as we attract more sponsors and fans, the growth potential becomes unlimited.

 Now consider the change that brings to that same high school scene. Finally, a means of recognition for those who lack the interest or ability to play sports, act out a scene or please a crowd with music. Now when you’re told to do something for your future, it’s arguable that you are investing in your future. So, to those siting on the couch pwning their friends in Halo, your path to glory awaits.
