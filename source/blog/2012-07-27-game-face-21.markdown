“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **bnet_scraper**

 [bnet_scraper](https://github.com/agoragames/bnet_scraper) is a Nokogiri-based scraper of Battle.net profile information. The release this week adds checks to prevent parse issues with accounts that don't ladder.
