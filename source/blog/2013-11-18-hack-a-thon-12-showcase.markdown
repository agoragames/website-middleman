Agora Games recently held its 12th Hack-a-thon, Thursday, November 7th â€“ Friday, November 8th, a 24 hour period in which employees may work on anything they want so long as it relates to Agora. Internet issues within our region slowed progress throughout the day, but the team managed to deliver some great projects.

 We are attempting to better document Hack-a-thon projects with audio and video. The following showcase is our first endeavor. Video quality is not wonderful, but the audio is worth a listen. We will have our technical kinks worked out by Hack-a-thon 13.

**Torus Dashboard**

Andrew, Aaron, and Vitaly built a dashboard to graph data in Torus. Additionally, Aaron released version 0.8.0 of kairos with support for Cassandra, available [here](https://github.com/agoragames/kairos), and wrote a lot of new documentation. He then integrated that with torus.

**Hydra Studio Tutorial**

Steve built our first Hydra Studio async tutorial, available [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/AgoraGames/Hydra+Async+Tutorial/hydra_async_tutorial_WEB.html). This tutorial will assist in guiding users through the process of building their very first asynchronous multiplayer game.

**FP Maze**

David Czarnecki began work on "The Maze Game". It procedurally generates mazes of varying difficulty and you win by making your way to the maze's exit.

**Automate SDK Release**

David Andrade wrote a simple gradle script to automatically package and release any of the Hydra SDK's. It will generate the appropriate archives, update the CHANGELOGs, and upload any files to our site.
