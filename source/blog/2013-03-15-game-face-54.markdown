“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **kairos**

 [kairos](https://github.com/agoragames/kairos) provides time series storage using a Redis backend. kairos is intended to replace RRD in situations where the scale of Redis is required, with as few dependencies on other packages as possible. A number of quick releases went out, but as of the 0.1.5 release, we fixed increment by integer on a Count series, added a Gauge type and fixed a bug turning relative interval definitions into integers for calculations in get() and series().

 **torus**

 [torus](https://github.com/agoragames/torus) is a service implementing the Carbon protocol to store time series data using [kairos](https://github.com/agoragames/kairos) and an HTTP server to query and analyze the data. As of the 0.1.3 release this week, torus now has relative date and gauge type support, transforms in a schema to replace or suppress key/value pairs and fixing a bug reading data from timeseries with relative time interval schemas.

 **vcr**

 [vcr](https://github.com/vcr/vcr) allows you to "record your test suite's HTTP interactions and replay them during future test runs for fast, deterministic, accurate tests." We [submitted a patch that was integrated](https://github.com/vcr/vcr/pull/278) to support the latest version of the [typhoeus](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus) HTTP library.
