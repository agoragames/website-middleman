“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **bnet_scraper**

 [bnet_scraper](https://github.com/agoragames/bnet_scraper/) is our Nokogiri-based scraper of Battle.net profiles. In 0.6.0, we added a GrandmasterScraper to pull all grandmasters by region, improved the portrait code as well as updating portrait names for anniversary.

 **confirm-with-reveal**

 [confirm-with-reveal](https://github.com/agoragames/confirm-with-reveal) is a replacement for window.confirm() using the Reveal modal popup plugin from Zurb Foundation. The latest release this week addresses form confirmation on submit, not on click. You can also check out the plugin in action on the [project page](http://agoragames.github.io/confirm-with-reveal/).

 **leaderboard_factory**

 [leaderboard_factory](https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard_factory) is a gem to help you define and work with a bunch of leaderboards, from, e.g. an ActiveModel object. The latest release fixes the specs to work with the leaderboard 3.0+ gem.

 **stache**

 [stache](https://github.com/agoragames/stache) is our Rails 3.x compatible Mustache/Handlebars Template Handler, with support for partials and a couple extra niceties to make sharing the raw templates with client-side javascript a little easier. The 1.0.1 release fixes a regression in mustache layout handling.
