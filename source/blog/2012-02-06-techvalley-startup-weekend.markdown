On March 3, 2012 [Startup Weekend](http://startupweekend.org/) comes to TechValley. Startup Weekend is a technology focused business competition, where people pitch ideas, form ad-hoc teams, and develop a product idea over the span of a weekend. Despite what a lot of people think, it's not a code competition in the spirit of the [Node Knockout](http://nodeknockout.com/) or [Rails Rumble](http://archive.railsrumble.com/); points aren't awarded based on cool tech alone. However, also unlike these other events, Startup Weekend focuses on producing real-life companies with making real money. (Like, for real, yo). Why should you care?

 **As a resident of the Capital Region, it's good for our economy**
 There are almost a dozen out of town Venture Capitalists, executives, and engineers travelling here to learn more about what we have to offer. This area has become increasing important due to our local engineering talent and our vicinity to both NYC and Boston. Startup Weekend is the perfect time to show off our entrepreneurial and technical prowess. It's my belief that while this region has all the right raw materials, it needs a grassroots spark to fan the flames.

 **As a business owner or manager, it's good for your company**
 Startup Weekend is a great way to let your company and your team think outside the bounds & constraints they work with during the week. It's also a great way to meet other local talent and test your wits against other people in the area. I promise you'll be surprised at all the small startups that exist right here under your nose. Finally, it shows your team, your customers, and your colleagues that you care about their field and our region. Win win!

 **As a software craftsperson, it's good for your career**
 No one stays in one place forever (particularly in our field). The opportunities locally aren't as abundant as they might be in a larger metropolitan area,but that itself creates a unique opportunity. Great startups (like all great teams) require the right mix of people. It's exceedingly rare to see a single individual take an idea and develop it into something meaningful on their own. Said another way, its more risky (resulting in a smaller potentially upside) to go it alone. At Startup Weekend you'll meet scores of other people interested in the business of technology. Who knows, maybe that idea you've had kicking around will take root and grow.
