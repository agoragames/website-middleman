“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **haigha**

 [haigha](https://github.com/agoragames/haigha) is our simple to use client library for interacting with AMQP brokers. In the 0.5.7 release, we fixed exception in handling in SocketTransport when sendall() raises a socket error. Also fixed was re-raising of exception on SocketTransport.read() so that it always marks the transport as closed.

 **leaderboard**

 [leaderboard](https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard/) allows you to build leaderboards using Redis. We are starting to think about functionality for version 3.0.0 and have opened [a couple of pull requests for version 3 proposals](https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard/pulls).

 **weary**

 [weary](https://github.com/mwunsch/weary) is a framework and DSL for building RESTful web service clients. Awhile back, we submitted a [pull request to add Excon and Typhoeus adapters](https://github.com/mwunsch/weary/pull/2). These have been integrated into the 1.1.0 release.
