 And we are back. Since our last announcement, the Hydra Studio team has rolled out a number of new features and enhancements. We still anticipate the launch of the Hydra Studio closed beta to the public later this year. Expect an official release date this Fall.

 Below is an overview of the new features we released during the summer. Please take a moment to review, and then head to the Hydra Studio dashboard and give everything a test run. Make sure to share your thoughts on the [Beta Support Forum](http://support.agoragames.com/discussions/hydra-mobile-closed-beta-general-discussion) as your feedback is extremely valuable.
## Matchmaking

Brand new to Hydra Studio, we released our matchmaking feature early this summer. Our team recognized that there are multiple ways to connect players into a match. We now support matchmaking for all types of games based on user’s needs.

- **Fluid, or Quick-Matches** - This Call of Duty style of matchmaking automatically creates a match and queries for other players who have defined the same set of criteria for a match type. If a match is unavailable, a new match is created. This style allows a match to exist while a search for other players continues and allows players to come and go.

- **Fixed, or Criteria-Based Matches** - This League of Legends style of matchmaking is suitable for match types that are session-based, or have a definitive beginning and end. This style promotes better matches by analyzing all current match requests and finding the best grouping of players.

## Match Enhancements

Hydra Studio’s match service has expanded and now provides the infrastructure needed to support various match options including:
- The ability to create a match, join a match or join a ranked match as a group
- An optional parameter to request a reserved spot for invites
- Matches and profiles can now request which fields are returned when updated/fetching, enhancing performance

## Friends Services
You can now promote deeper levels of engagement by providing enhanced visibility within a player’s social circle. Combine existing friend features with our new friend interaction features:

- Notifications for successful friend additions
- The ability to get the online status of friends
- The ability to get presence notifications for friends (a change in online/offline)
- The ability to track and display mutual friends for a user

Additionally, security and privacy enhancements may be used to provide players with the ability to block individual users, or set a global block to make an entire profile private.

## C++ SDK
Now available for download, the Hydra Studio team has added our first iteration of a low-level SDK for maximum cross-device compatibility. We leveraged this early C++ SDK after a number of beta users requested Windows Support. Check out our demo app, publicly available [here](http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/marble-maze-hydra-sample/630bf4d6-4bf0-4af9-a8d3-e9342c4c93c3).
## Everything Else
In addition to the top level features above, we released a number of smaller updates during the summer months:

 **1. Realtime Multiplayer** - Improving on our Realtime Networking, we have added the ability to store temporary data about match state and time/latency of server session.

 **2. Log Viewer** - Errors generated during Dashboard use are now viewable and automatically saved with available JSON.

 **3. Improvements to Analytics/Stats Display** - Snapshot statistics, such as total profile count, have been added to our Statistics Display. We will continue to add to our available analytics over time.

 **4. Added Stability Index** - Stability for each feature is now displayed above their respective overview. View the Stability Index [here](https://hydra.agoragames.com/documentation/index.html#).

 **5. Improved Documentation Home Page and Added Documentation Search Feature**

## Still To Come

Here is a list of the features that are currently under development, and that you'll be able to get your hands on soon:

 **Friends** - Facebook friend import

 **Basic Username & Password Auth Support** - Will provide developers the opportunity to create and authorize profiles within Hydra studio using a standard username and password format.

 **Continued Platform Load Testing and Infrastructure Enhancements** - Will strengthen the performance of our entire feature set and global deploy support.

 **Continued Research into Additional Engine Support** - We’ll look to continue expanding the amount of engines Hydra Studio can work with. We’re already looking at Marmalade and other engines suggested by beta users, so keep your feedback coming!



 Feel free to post questions on any of these features in our [Beta Support Forum](http://support.agoragames.com/discussions/hydra-mobile-closed-beta-general-discussion), and continue to put our platform to the test. Thanks a ton!
