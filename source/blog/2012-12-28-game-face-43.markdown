“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **leaderboard-coffeescript**

 [leaderboard-coffeescript](https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-coffeescript) is our leaderboard project, originally written in Ruby, ported to CoffeeScript. Both this version and the [leaderboard-python](https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-python) port have 100% feature parity with the [original Ruby library](https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard). We will do a formal 1.0.0 release of this library once we work out what to do with respect to naming since there is an existing leaderboard library available from the Node Package Manager.
