title: 'Saints Row: The Third launches GOTY Edition - Where Agora fits in'

Agora Games is proud to have had our Hydra product be a part of [Saint Row: The Third](http://www.saintsrow.com/). With the launch of the Game of The Year edition today in North America (the rest of the world gets it on Nov. 16th), I wanted to run down some of the real cool things that Hydra was used for to help make this title a huge success! Keep in mind that there are a lot more services being used by SR3, but I thought these were a few of the coolest!

 **Profiles**

 Utilizing our profile service, the web team was able to put together an awesome user experience for the fans.  We made it possible for a user to create an account in game, then go right to the community website and login with those credentials.  On the [SR3 community website](http://www.saintsrow.com/community) users were able to check out their stats and see how they stacked up against the rest of the world. Profiles are used to track a player's lifetime stats and many other essential player data points (game progress, achievements unlocked, etc). So anytime you're signed in online, and play SR3, your profile is being tracked by Agora Games!

 Check out these screen shots of the SR3 user profile page!

 As you can see, there is a ton of data being tracked on a per player basis. Everything from total kills, money earned, missions complete and hundreds other. Almost every stat has a "Community Average" where it shows how you stack up against the community as a whole. In Profile Pic 2, you can even see that you can compare your stats to anyone in the community!

 **Leaderboards**

 Leaderboards are one of the most utilized Hydra services. While first party integration does have SOME leaderboards, they are limited to 1st party restrictions. Agora gives you the chance to really blow out your game's leaderboards. Any stat you have in game, we can make it into a leaderboard. Want to combine stats to make multi-value leaderboards? We'll do that too. We can even make a leaderboard that shows how many kills players got on a Tuesday with a handgun while in a car, and then tell you which was their favorite car while doing it! If it's in your game data, we'll provide the magic.

 Here is an example of what Saints Row did with [their leaderboards. ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/24388/idi0lh4k461vok3/Screen%20Shot%202012-11-06%20at%203.16.00%20PM.png) As you can see, this leaderboard is tracking how much cash a user earned, per hour of game play. So we're combining multiple stats to get 1 stat for a totally unique leaderboard. That's some mighty fine calculations there!

 **User Generated Content**

 One of the big things that we did with the SR3 title was User Generated Content (or UGC). If you've played the game, and millions of you have (we track that too!), you know that you get to create and customize your own characters to play with in game. But what made this feature truly awesome is, you could [create a character in-game](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/22229/8jdre3s0v51nqqq/BigBarbraingame.png). That character would then get [uploaded to the website,](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/22229/cqwficw4tw42z4p/Screen%20Shot%202012-11-06%20at%203.52.34%20PM.png) where other users could download it to their console and play with it in their game!

 We even helped the Volition team power their Initiation Station pre-launch demo, which allowed users to create in-game characters prior to the actual game launch. Users could then download those characters into the full-title when they picked it up on launch day.

 **Global Feed Service**

 One of the other really cool features we did was called the Global Feed Service. We were able to send the website near-realtime data which would populate a map of the the SR3 world (Steelport) with a live feed of what was happening in game. As something interesting happened in game, it popped up on the map on the website as an event. Hit someone in the privates? [Put it on the big board!](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/22229/enxbofnjv0r9raj/Screen%20Shot%202012-11-06%20at%202.56.56%20PM.png)

 This was taken a step further when screenshots were added to the map. In the middle of an awesome battle with the cops, or midair in a jump over an airplane? [Take a screenshot.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/22229/xuxtsa6987k6h6b/Screen%20Shot%202012-11-06%20at%204.49.01%20PM.png) The coordinates of where you are in game, as well as the image, are sent right to your map on the website!

 Impressed by what you see? Then do 2 things: 1. Go pick up SR3's GOTY edition. You get all the DLC and everything ever released for it, so it's a steal. And 2. hit us up at [hydra.agoragames.com](hydra.agoragames.com) if you interested in getting any of these awesome features in your game!
