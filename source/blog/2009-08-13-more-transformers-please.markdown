Once again, our work for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen on the Nintendo DS has been 'called out'. This time it's Wii DS UK from - you guessed it - across the pond. They call Battle For Eath a, "bright light." Here's their bit about Battle For Earth:

> _While there’s the usual ‘link-up with your friends and kill them’-style deathmatch, allowing players who own either version of the game to pound on each other with the named characters from the story or their character from the main game, there’s also a special mode called Battle For Earth, which lets players duke it out for fame and glory, a list of the best players available on the official website.  The missions are more or less the same as the ones available in the main storyline, so it’s not ‘true’ DLC, but it’s certainly a step in the right direction for any DS owners looking at their console-owning comrades in jealousy._
