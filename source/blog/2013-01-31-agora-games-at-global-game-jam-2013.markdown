The Global Game Jam (GGJ) is the world's largest game jam event. Think of it as a hackathon focused on game development. It is the growth of an idea that in today's heavily connected world, we could com together, be creative, share experiences and express ourselves in a multitude of ways using videos - it if very universal.

The Albany chapter of the International Game Developers Association is the host for the GGJ in our area in upstate New York. Each year the crowd seems to grow, and this year was no different with over 40 people participating in the weekend long event being housed at SUNY Albany. This year's Game Jam took place on 6 different continents, in 63 countries, at 321 different sites. This truly is the definition of an international event.

The theme for this year's GGJ was "Heartbeat". There some projects that dealt with the theme by having the game adjust to how fast or slow you moved. If you moved faster, your heart rate increased along with objects in the game. If you slowed down for to long, you would die. One of the titles dealt with Social Anxiety for their game. The game's objective was to try to approach a certain person at a party you were attending. As you got closer to that person, it got harder to move and function, much like in real life for people who suffer from social anxieties.

Agora Games is a big believer in shared knowledge in the gaming and tech industry, which is evident by our extensive catalog of open sourced projects. We have been a proud sponsor of our local GGJ for a couple years now, and each year we send over a few people to check out the action and talk with the teams. Check out some photos below!
