“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **chai**

 [chai](https://github.com/agoragames/chai) provides a very easy to use api for mocking/stubbing your python objects, patterned after the [Mocha](http://mocha.rubyforge.org/) library for Ruby. With the release of chai 0.4.2, we've addressed UnexpectedCall handling with Python 2 as well as fixing a regression in not raising an AssertionError for Python 2.

 **haigha**

 [haigha](https://github.com/agoragames/haigha) is our simple to use client library for interacting with AMQP brokers. In the latest release, 0.6.1, we fixed an exception raising when there's an application error on a synchronous transport, fixed synchronous return values from queue.declare and we added an example synchronous RPC client and server.

 **kairos**

 [kairos](https://github.com/agoragames/kairos) provides time series storage using Redis or Mongo backends. In kairos 0.5.0, we now provide callers with the ability to customize the fetching of data from a timeseries.
