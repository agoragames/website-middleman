August 4th 3:00 PM: Excitement looms in their eyes as they await the fourth coming. An extraordinary combination of producers, interns, devs and more, unify to kick off the event of the century: Hack-A-thon 4. What is a Hack-a-thon you ask? Well, I'm glad you did because only the foolish can live in ignorance of the mankind’s greatest celebration. It is only that moment that we’ve all dreamed of and considered impossible as children. The one moment that all of our parents told us about, but never truly believed we’d actually see. The period when you’re granted the highest level of honor and allowed 24 hours to work on any project that should strike your chord of desire. Brilliant, isn’t it? Now, the Agorians are an interesting people. Masters of the event is only the least that could be said of their Hack-a-thon abilities.

 Seeking the guiding words that will resound with them through the night’s perils, they sit restlessly as they await the official orders of the commander.

 In a flash, he enters and our leader speaks. The speech rebounds off of the walls with power and echos through everyone’s mind. Simultaneously, he is demanding yet asking, telling yet not, requiring but not really. More or less something like this:

 Having internalized the words that would hype them up to a sense of self-belief and desire to work, the diverse people of the Agora rejoice. They then disperse to attack the monstrous tasks that they have chosen to resolve.

 Agust 4th 7:00PM: Although four hours have passed, the Agorians are still hard at work. Their determination prevents any pesky amount of noise or discomfort from discouraging them and preventing the success of the vision at hand. They have a task to fulfill and intend to do so. Bright eyed and in high spirit, they continue to bang away at their instruments.

 Some have even been inspired to a level where chairs are irrelevant; working while standing up, an unnecessary yet amazing triumph.

 August 5th 5:00AM: The Agorians have taken the ultimate form of humankind. The zombie. Driven by their goals, the Agorian continues. He continues working without the slightest thought of rest.

 Having diligently continued regardless of the obstacles, 3:00 PM arrives and the event is concluded. All of the Agorians meet at the same place that their tasks were appointed to speak of their successes and failures. Another grand Hack-a-thon has been successfully completed. Many accomplishments came out of this event and will be implemented into the natural flow of life soon.
