“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **chai**

 [chai](https://github.com/agoragames/chai) provides a very easy to use api for mocking/stubbing your python objects, patterned after the [Mocha](http://mocha.rubyforge.org/) library for Ruby. As of the 0.4.0 release of chai, the library now supports Python 3!

 **kairos**

 [kairos](https://github.com/agoragames/kairos) provides time series storage using Redis or Mongo backends. This week we integrated a [pull request to pin the MonthDelta library requirement](https://github.com/agoragames/kairos/pull/22) to avoid a potential issue with naming.
