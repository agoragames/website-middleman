“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 [In 2011, we open sourced 22 projects](http://blog.agoragames.com/blog/2012/01/09/2011-open-source-projects/). In 2012, we open sourced 33 projects. We're looking forward to 2013! You can find all of our open source projects from us on the [Agora Games GitHub organization](https://github.com/agoragames/).

- [bracket_tree](https://github.com/agoragames/bracket_tree) - BracketTree is a bracketing system built around the BracketTree Data Specification, which uses a three-section data structure built on top of JSON to convey the visual representation, progression logic, and seed mapping in a serializable format. For more information on the data specification, please read the [BracketTree Data Specification](https://github.com/agoragames/bracket_tree/wiki/BracketTree-Data-Specification).
- [bracket_tree.renderer](https://github.com/agoragames/bracket_tree.renderer) - BracketTree.Renderer is a d3-based bracket rendering system for all BracketTree tournaments. It is designed to interpret the BracketTree data visually based on the Renderer selected. There are a number of renderers built-in, as well as the ability to create your own.

Gem::Repackager packages one or more of your installed gems back into .gem files for easy transportation. Gem::Repackager comes with a command-line utility to facilitate, with easy extensibility in the code as well.
- [GWFSelect-for-jQuery-UI](https://github.com/agoragames/GWFSelect-for-jQuery-UI) - Based very loosely on Tom Moor's plugin for selecting Google's hosted fonts from a dynamically-generated drop-down list. This version uses jQuery UI's widget factory to provide the standard tools for accessing and manipulating the plugin's state programmatically.
- [kairos](https://github.com/agoragames/kairos) - Kairos provides time series storage using a Redis backend. Kairos is intended to replace RRD in situations where the scale of Redis is required, with as few dependencies on other packages as possible. It should work with gevent out of the box.
