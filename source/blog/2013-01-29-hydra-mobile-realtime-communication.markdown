Hydra Mobile is the newest product from Agora Games and each week or so we’ll be releasing detailed information about features, an update from the beta, and anything else that you folks might want to know about Hydra Mobile. If we’re not talking about what you want to know about, let us know, and we’ll get that information to you info@agoragames.com.

### Realtime Communication
Hydra facilitates low-latency bidirectional communication of game events. Developers using Hydra can focus on the aspects of their multiplayer games that are unique and compelling, without having to manage the complex and costly network infrastructure that is often required to support those games.

 This realtime communication will primarily be used in conjunction with our match service. With the power of cloud storage, matchmaking, and realtime messaging being in the same software stack, we can offer some amazing features.

 The realtime server can also facilitate notifications that originate from our servers. These notifications can be anything from game invites to achievements awarded. Notifications which are sent via the realtime server can offer faster delivery and can contain larger payloads, although, notifications can also be sent via other channels if your game isn't using the realtime server.
### Beta Update
And, just as a quick update about the beta, we are preparing for a mid February launch of the expanded beta. Current beta users don't need to change anything, so no worries. If you're interested in getting into this next phase of our beta, please head to hydra.agoragames.com and click the sign up button. This next phase is still a closed beta, but we will be expanding the group of testers so we can begin load testing our systems.
