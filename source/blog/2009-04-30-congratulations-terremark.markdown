We've used a lot of hosting providers in our time.  (A lot as in **A LOT**)  However, at this point most of our premier projects are hosted in our shared service environment at [Terremark](http://www.terremark.com/).  This has been a win all around for us, increasing up-time and decreasing costs to our customers.

 This week [Terremark](http://www.terremark.com/) won an award for their Enterprise Cloud system (which we've used since it was in Alpha) and we're really proud of them.  So from all of us as Agora to all of the fine folks at [Terremark](http://www.terremark.com/), congratulations!
