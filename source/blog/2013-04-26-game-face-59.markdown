“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **confirm-with-reveal**

 [confirm-with-reveal](https://github.com/agoragames/confirm-with-reveal) is a replacement for window.confirm() using the Reveal modal popup plugin from Zurb Foundation. See [example jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/PtVNW/) for a demo.

 **Ruby-MAPI-Wrapper**

 [brightcove-api](https://github.com/BrightcoveOS/Ruby-MAPI-Wrapper) is a Ruby gem for interacting with the Brightcove Media API. This week we integrated a pull request to [ allow an UploadIO object to be passed to the post_io_streaming method](https://github.com/BrightcoveOS/Ruby-MAPI-Wrapper/pull/9).
