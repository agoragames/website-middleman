Steve, Elliott, and Brad of Agora Games joined an estimated 24,000 attendees at this year’s Game Developers Conference. While in San Francisco, they had the opportunity to meet with a number of clients, partners, and industry professionals to talk about what is new and exciting at Agora. 

We are happy to report that interest in the Hydra platform was once again very strong throughout our entire week at GDC.  The many connections and conversations that our team participated in during this year’s GDC conference will be showcased in a number of exciting titles planned for release in 2014 and 2015.

We want to take this opportunity to thank all of the individuals who met with the Agora Games team at GDC 2014.  Your support and feedback is greatly appreciated, and we look forward to another exciting year working with our development partners.
