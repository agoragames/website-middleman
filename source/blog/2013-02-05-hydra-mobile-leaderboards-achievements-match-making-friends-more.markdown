Here at [Agora Games](http://www.agoragames.com/), we've been working on an online service platform called  [Hydra](http://hydra.agoragames.com/). This platform is used to power in-game and web-based features, such as player stats, leaderboards & achievements for lots of popular titles (Guitar Hero series, Saints Row 3, Mortal Kombat, etc). We have developed a mobile-focused version of our platform so that you can take advantage of all of these great features in your Android and iOS Unity3d games!

**Currently Supported Features:**

- **Profile** - Show your players their personal gameplay stats and match history.
- **Login/Authorization** - Users are automatically logged in upon opening the game...no need for additional usernames and passwords (or optional facebook/twitter/etc authentication).
- **Friends** - Enable your users to build a friends list to set up matches and coordinate.
- **Leaderboards** - Rank your users globally and among friends.
- **Match-Making** - Simple match creation and match finding tools (supporting realtime games and async games)
- **Realtime Messages** - Send fast realtime game messages to everyone in a match
- **Achievements** - Reward your players with awards based on game progress, and notify your users in-game notifications.
- **Message of the Day** - Tool to schedule the delivery of global messages or "Message of the Day"
- **Notifications** - Custom realtime notifications and native platform dependant push notifications
- **Cross-Platform** - Works on both Android and iPhone!
- **Developer Dashboards** - All developers have access to our dashboard with tools for viewing data, setting up features and download docs and SDKs
