This weekend, MLG held a highly competitive, highly anticipated competition to test the strengths of pro gamers alike. The Pro Circuit, this time in Columbus, Ohio, included a number of competitors facing off for champion status in StarCraft 2, Halo: Reach and Call of Duty: Black Ops.  The three-day event concluded as follows:



 **StarCraft 2**

 SlayerSMMA, the “Terran” prodigy, defeated second place winner IMLosira in the finals with a four to one win. MMA didn’t lose a single series all weekend and only dropped two games in total. Entering game four with a two-to-one lead, MMA survived massive Roach/Baneling attacks and executed excellent drop plays to shut Losira down. In game five, MMA deployed early reapers to kill off Losira’s drones. He eventually followed up with a big Marine/Tank force to force the surrender.

 **Halo:** Reach

 Dropping just one map, team Instinct, consisting of Ogre 2, Roy, Lunchbox and Pistola, were crowned MLG Columbus Halo champions. Instinct left with an amazing record of 21:1 after having defeated second place winner Str8 Rippin. It wasn’t until facing third place winners Dynasty in the WB final that they dropped a game. That however didn’t faze the team as they continued on to win the match and dominate the tournament.

 **Call of Duty:** Black Ops

 MLG Columbus produced a surprising sequence of events during the Call of Duty match ups. As day three continued, some of the highly favored teams fell into the losers bracket and the finals ended in an unexpected sweep. Optic Gaming was the victor who claimed the Black Ops Pro Circuit trophy.  Force, who was originally twelfth seeded, earned second place after losing six to none.

 Overall, the event continues to open doors for young teams like Fly Society who placed ninth, but managed to make a name for themselves. Congratulations to all of the winners and shout out to everyone who helped make this possible. The next event is in July at Anaheim, CA; can you afford to miss greatness in the making? http:www.majorleaguegaming.com
