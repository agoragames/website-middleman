“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **coffeescript-streak**

 [coffeescript-streak](https://github.com/czarneckid/coffeescript-streak/) is a port of the [streak Ruby gem](https://github.com/czarneckid/streak) which handles calculating win/loss streaks. It uses Redis as its backend for collecting the data. It has also been uploaded to the [npm registry](http://search.npmjs.org/#/streak).
