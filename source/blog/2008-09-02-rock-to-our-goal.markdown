This past Thursday, we hosted Rock To A Cure in partnership with Bombers Burrito Bar. The verdict, a total success. The final count of money raised was over $1,400! It was night which will be remembered - or be a blurry vision for those who had one too many Agora Gamers - by all. While the dinner crowd chowed down some burritos all of us were busy hyping up the crowd, raising awareness for the [Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation](http://www.jdrf.org/) (JDRF), and just being amiable hosts. Once the dinner crowd was finished with their burritos they were still hungry, hungry for Guitar Hero. Everyone started joining in to play Guitar Hero and Nicole was practically drowning in raffles. Luckily CZ was there to give a hand and rescue Nicole from the raffle abyss.

If things weren't crazy enough already Mike DelPrete decided to "kick things up a notch" by suggesting some good ol' fashion arm wrestling. The burly Dave Loya took on contestants from the floor and went undefeated until the last round where one of the members of the crowd brought him down hard.

 The event went well past 10PM ending close to 11PM where everyone was eagerly awaiting the raffle of the XBox 360 which was taken home by a fine gentleman who was there the entire night and bought over $100 in raffle tickets! Definitely well deserved. With Rock To A Cure being such a success this is only the beginning to many more charity events to come.
