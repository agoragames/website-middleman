“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **bnet_scraper**

 [bnet_scraper](https://github.com/agoragames/bnet_scraper/) is our Nokogiri-based scraper of Battle.net profiles. The 0.3.0 and 0.3.1 releases encompass changes to add portrait name scraping to ProfileScraper as well as to throw BnetScraper::InvalidProfileError when instantiating a scraper with a poorly formatted profile URL.

 **gem_repackager**

 [gem_repackager](https://github.com/cadwallion/gem_repackager) packages one or more of your installed gems back into .gem files for easy transportation. You might use this if you ever been without internet and needed a gem but it's in the wrong RVM gemset? How about attempting to correct a problem with a production environment and need to clone the exact gems available? Perhaps you are attempting a full app stack backup for compliance purposes?
