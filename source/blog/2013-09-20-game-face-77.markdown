“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **chai**

 [chai](https://github.com/agoragames/chai) provides a very easy to use api for mocking/stubbing your python objects, patterned after the [Mocha](http://mocha.rubyforge.org/) library for Ruby. chai 0.4.3 fixes a regression in stubbing functions introduced in Python 3 changes.

 **saltstack-sandbox**

 [saltstack-sandbox](https://github.com/agoragames/saltstack-sandbox) is a [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)-based sandbox environment for experimenting with [SaltStack](http://saltstack.com/). The initial release has been made available for others to experiment with SaltStack in an isolated environment.
