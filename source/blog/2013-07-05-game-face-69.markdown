“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **forecast.io**

 [forecast-ruby](https://github.com/darkskyapp/forecast-ruby) is a [forecast.io](https://developer.darkskyapp.com/docs/v2) API wrapper in Ruby. This week we released 2 versions: 1.2.0 adds the ability to define default parameters that get sent along with each request, while 2.0.0 changes the namespace for the library from Forecast::IO to ForecastIO. All development going forward will be done in the 2.0.0 branch.

 **torus**

 [torus](https://github.com/agoragames/torus) is a service implementing the Carbon protocol to store time series data using [kairos](https://github.com/agoragames/kairos) and an HTTP server to query and analyze the data. We made a number of significant updates in the 0.4.0 release. Stat queries can be comma-separated values to join multiple timeseries. A "collapse" parameter was added to "/series" which supports collapsing all of the data in the date range into a single result. This supports easy computation of aggregates across a time range, such as "maximum value in the last 7 days". Schemas can include "TRANSFORMS" stanza for defining a named map of data transforms that will be used when querying torus. hiredis is now a requirement as redis is not performant enough without it. Finally, a number of command-line and configuration changes were made as detailed in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/agoragames/torus/blob/master/CHANGELOG).
