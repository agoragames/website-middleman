“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **gamertag**

 [gamertag](https://github.com/barisbalic/gamertag) is an interface for accessing your XBOX Live profile and game data. In the 1.0.3 release, we removed the version numbers in the dependencies and development dependencies for the gem. We also merged a pull request to escape user input when creating an URI.

 **leaderboard**

 [leaderboard](https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard/) allows you to build leaderboards using Redis. We released version 3.0.1 this week to fix a bug in remove_member that would remove all of the optional member data.

 **leaderboard-python**

 [leaderboard-python](https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-python) is our leaderboard project, originally written in Ruby, ported to Python. We released 2.2.1 that updates the remove_member method to also remove the optional member data for the member being removed.
