“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **activity_feed**

 [activity_feed](https://github.com/agoragames/activity_feed) is our Ruby gem for storing and managing activity feeds in Redis. In the 2.2.0 update, we added expire_feed and expire_feed_at methods to be able to set an expiration on a feed after a given number of seconds or at a given timestamp, respectively.

 **amico**

 [amico](https://github.com/agoragames/amico) is our Ruby gem for managing relationships (e.g. friendships) backed by Redis. We added a couple of convenience methods, count and page_count, to retrieve the count or the page count for the various types of relationships. This  functionality is available in the 2.1.0 release.

 **php-bracket_tree**

 [php-bracket_tree](https://github.com/agoragames/php-bracket_tree) is a PHP port of our [bracket_tree](https://github.com/agoragames/bracket_tree) project. bracket_tree is a bracketing system built around the BracketTree Data Specification, which uses a three-section data structure built on top of JSON to convey the visual representation, progression logic, and seed mapping in a serializable format. For more information on the data specification, please read the [BracketTree Data Specification](https://github.com/agoragames/bracket_tree/wiki/BracketTree-Data-Specification).

 **seed_list**

 [seed_list](https://github.com/agoragames/seed_list) is a new Ruby gem we released this week that provides seed management for tournament brackets. SeedList is designed for Rails-powered tournament engines that need to persist a 1-indexed ordered list of players (ranked low-to-high by skill or past performance) and then match them up appropriately in the first round of a bracket. Players are then matched up according to a strategy specified on a per-instance basis.
