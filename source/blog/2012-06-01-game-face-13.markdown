“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **homebrew**

 [homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/) is called the missing package manager for OS X. It's a great way to install software like git, MySQL, Riak, and more. We submitted a [pull request to update the Redis formula to 2.4.14](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/pull/12488).

 **redis-namespace**

 [redis-namespace](https://github.com/defunkt/redis-namespace) is a gem which can be used to namespace Redis keys. Although Redis 2.6 is still in-development, one of our engineers submitted a [pull request to add the new Redis 2.6 commands that should be namespaced](https://github.com/defunkt/redis-namespace/pull/40).
