I am pleased to announce the [brightcove-api gem](https://github.com/BrightcoveOS/Ruby-MAPI-Wrapper) that I maintain has a new home at the [Brightcove Open Source portal](http://opensource.brightcove.com/).



 In June 2010, I wrote the brightcove-api gem to interact with the [Brightcove](http://www.brightcove.com/en/) media APIs. We've used it to build sites like [MLG.tv](http://tv.majorleaguegaming.com/). Last night I attended the NY Brightcove User's Group meeting and found out about their [Brightcove Open Source portal](http://opensource.brightcove.com/). So, I wrote to the good folks behind the Open Source @ Brightcove effort to get the brightcove-api gem added to their third party projects. They offered me door #2 and a chance to make it the officially "official" library for interacting with the Brightcove Media API from Ruby.

 And so here we are, the brightcove-api gem now lives alongside the other open source libraries for interacting with Brightcove. I'll still be the maintainer of the library and since it's open source, you can and always will be able to contribute to its continued development.

 You can find more hilarity over on my Twitter account, [CzarneckiD](http://twitter.com/czarneckid).
