Well, we came, we talked, we kicked some ... (you know)!

 This year Agora had two talks accepted to Railsconf.  Both were received exceedingly well and you can find the slides [here](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/schedule/proceedings "link to slides at railsconf").

 Congratulations to all of our presenters including: David Czarnecki, Ola Mork, Eric Torrey and Jason LaPorte.  Nice work guys!
