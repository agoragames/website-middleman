title: 'Amistad: Friendships in Rails 3'
author: David Czarnecki

If you're looking for a way to do friendships in Rails 3, you might have a look at [Amistad](http://github.com/raw1z/amistad). I added support for blocking friendship requests and [those changes](http://github.com/raw1z/amistad/commit/28ad024bda7a46a28de13a65d499e2318aa4c352) have been integrated into master. One of the benefits of contributing this code was I got some exposure to [RSpec](http://rspec.info/).

 Enjoy!
