### MAJOR LEAGUE GAMING ACQUIRES AGORA GAMES

> _Deal brings online, multi-platform development expertise to fast-growing competitive gaming property_

 **NEW YORK CITY—AUGUST 18, 2009—**Major League Gaming today announced that it has acquired Troy, NY-based Agora Games. Known for both its technical expertise and elegant product development, Agora has built some of the leading video game community applications in the industry. Together, Agora and MLG will work both to enhance MLG’s online offerings, as well as to expand the services that both companies currently offer to the game publishing community.

 “Cross-platform video game competition is what MLG is all about,” said Matthew Bromberg, president and CEO of Major League Gaming. “We already operate the largest online competitive gaming property in the world. Agora is the leading developer of multi-player communities in the world. Coming together with Agora allows us to double-down on our biggest strength.”

 Over the last four years, Agora has developed some of gaming’s highest profile, most ambitious community websites for titles including Guitar Hero, Transformers, Call of Duty World at War, and Dance Dance Revolution. Their technology currently tracks game play statistics for over 25 million players around the world. Founder Michael DelPrete will remain as president of the wholly-owned subsidiary. Agora will continue to operate out of its Troy, NY office. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

 “MLG has shown the world that competitive video gaming is both a great live sports experience and can be the basis for a thriving online business,” said Michael DelPrete, founder of Agora Games. “We share a vision of the marketplace, and we’re confident the combination will better serve our existing customers and open up new opportunities to expand our offerings.”

 The acquisition presents significant opportunities for game publishers. Agora has become the go-to technology developer for handheld and web-based extensions of video game experiences. Major League Gaming has proven its ability to build massive audiences around exciting new competitive social experiences. Together, Agora and MLG will partner more deeply with publishers and developers looking for deeper engagement, more ever-green experiences, and greater unit volume.
