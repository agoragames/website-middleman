Success pertains to anyone willing to grab it, however, the majority will experience it through different channels. A lot of people measure success by a person’s current status; what they have, who they know and ultimately where they are. Only, is this a correct scale upon which to measure a person’s triumphs? When measuring success, should you look at the point where a person has landed or consider the journey from where they made the initial jump?

 Personally, I prefer to look at the whole picture as opposed to one part of it. The fact of the matter is, although all men were created equal, not all were born with the same opportunities. Ultimately, we have the potential to reach the highest form of glory as well as the lowest. That’s why my measure of success is based on analyzing the whole path that a person has traveled. Someone starting at a lower position has a lot more work to put in, but can eventually reach the highest outcome.

 The world has many opportunities to offer and many are determined enough to recognize them. One example of this is Mike DelPrete, the CEO of Agora Games. Mike started Agora Games eight years ago and it thrived both before and after it’s acquisition by MLG. When I asked Mike what the secret to his success was, he told me to ”get back to work.” Idealistically, I took that for stay focused and continue with the task at hand. After surviving his ocean of emails, meetings and conferences, Mike specified “hard work, determination, and having an open mind.”

 The pillars of success reside on the platform of determination. Needless to say, that platform isn’t leveled. This is one of the leading causes of the gap between those who prosper and those who fall behind. The result that you can expect to gain from any experience is positively correlated to the sacrifices that you’re willing to make. Of course some dream bigger than others, but many fail to make it through the first stage: desire. Without a constant desire for something greater, can you expect progress?
