I'm Steven. I hail from the suburbs of Boston and I'm currently a 3rd year student at the Rochester Institute of Technology where we are required to do a minimum of 12 months of full time co-op before graduation.Â Agora Games is my 3rd and final co-op experience and I'm very excited to be working here!
