title: 'Hack-a-thon #13 Complete!'

Hey everyone,

 We just had another amazing hack-a-thon here at Agora Games. For those of you who still don't know, every 2 months we put on a hack-a-thon event where, for 24 hours, all employees at Agora can work on whatever they want. It has to be tangentially related to what we do here at Agora, and you must have something completed by the end of the 24 hours. It's been a great tradition here at Agora, and is one we're looking to continue on for a long time!

 Here a few of the projects from this hack-a-thon:

 \* **Jack Letourneau** - Worked on a web UI for creating compound Boolean queries up to one level deep in the drag-and-drop style of iOS's icon folders (drop one term onto another to create a new group).

 \* **Brad Lafountain** - Got our C++ SDK working with the Android NDK. Also worked on one of our Hydra demos (Verbs with Friends).

 \* **David Andrade** - Added several of our SDKs to a continuous integration server

 \* **Steven Flenory** - Submitted our beta Unity SDK to the Asset Store. Prepared community posts for open sign up

 I love seeing how each of the projects vary across the individuals on the team! We'll be at it again in 2 months. Let us know if you have any cool ideas for us to work on!

 - Steve
