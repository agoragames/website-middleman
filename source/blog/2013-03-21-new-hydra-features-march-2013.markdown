 The Hydra Team has been very busy during the month of March, and we've already released a number of features we have planned for our upcoming milestone (currently targeted for completion in May 2013).

 Below is an overview of the new features we released this month. Take a quick read, and then head to the Hydra dashboard and give everything a test run. Make sure you let us know your thoughts on the [Beta Support Forum](http://support.agoragames.com/discussions/hydra-mobile-closed-beta-general-discussion) as your feedback is extremely valuable.

## Time-based Leaderboards

[ ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/22229/i4od66jk26q5a5i/timebasedlbs.png) ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/22229/i4od66jk26q5a5i/timebasedlbs.png)

 You can now easily create leaderboards that automatically expire and reset based on the time criteria you designate (daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly). Combine this new functionality with the global leaderboard support we already have in place, and you have a very solid leaderboard offering to make available to your users. Read our updated leaderboard documentation [here](https://hydra.agoragames.com/documentation/leaderboards.html).

## Match Configuration Enhancements

 The 1st iteration of the Hydra match template system allows you to easily create reusable match configurations. Those match configurations can then be used in matchmaking, ranked matches, and other Hydra services. Early match template documentation is available [here](https://hydra.agoragames.com/documentation/match_templates.html).

## Data Viewer Enhancements

[ ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/22229/tz06dypg7skhtr5/dashboard%20updates.png) ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/22229/tz06dypg7skhtr5/dashboard%20updates.png)

 We've improved the Hydra dashboard data viewer in a number of ways that will make your development and QA easier. You can now view profile, achievement, and match data for individual users right in the Hydra dashboard. Access the profile data page of the Hydra dashboard, type in a user's profile name, and click search. We've organized this data so it's easy to access, and easy on the eyes.

 Additionally, you can now view all of the leaderboard data coming from your game right in the Hydra dashboard. Access the leaderboards page of the Hydra dashboard, and then click the "Show" button next to the leaderboard you want to view.

## Everything else

In addition to the top level features above, we released a number of smaller updates during the month of March:

 1. **Leaderboards based on match stats** - Users can now generate leaderboards and achievements based on match values (win, loss, rank)

 2. **Realtime Server Enhancements** - We've shrunk data transfer sizes and optimized for speed and performance.

 3. **SDK Auto-detect** - If you're using an out-of-date SDK, we'll automatically let you know that you need to update (by way of relevant error messaging).

 4. **Sexier Splash Page** - Includes an improved overview of our high level feature set, and looks damn good. View it [here](http://hydra.agoragames.com/splash).

## Still to come

Here is a list of the features that are currently under development, and that you'll be able to get your hands on soon:

**User Accounts**

- Facebook account authorization

**Friends**

- Facebook friend import

**Chat/Presence**

- First iteration of match/lobby chat functionality

**Pricing / Payment Processing**

- First iteration of payment processing and account management

Feel free to post questions on any of these features in our  [Beta Support Forum](http://support.agoragames.com/discussions/hydra-mobile-closed-beta-general-discussion), and continue to put our platform to the test. Thanks a ton!
