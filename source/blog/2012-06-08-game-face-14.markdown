“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right?

 **capistrano**

 [capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano) is one of those great tools that can help you simplify and automate deployment of web applications in distributed environments.

We couldn't remember, so we submitted a [pull request to have the default SCM changed from Subversion to git](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/pull/218). It looks like this should get merged in with some other work. Fingers crossed!
