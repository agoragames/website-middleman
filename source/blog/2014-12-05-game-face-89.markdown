"Game Face" will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

**chai**

[chai](https://github.com/agoragames/chai) provides a very easy to use api for mocking/stubbing your python objects, patterned after the [Mocha](http://mocha.rubyforge.org/) library for Ruby. This week we released chai 1.0.1. chai 1.0.1 fixes tests and unbound method support in Python 3.

**haigha**

[haigha](https://github.com/agoragames/haigha) is our simple to use client library for interacting with AMQP brokers. In 0.7.2, we fixed installation under Windows.
