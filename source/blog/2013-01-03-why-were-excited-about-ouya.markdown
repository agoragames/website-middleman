There has been a lot of talk these days about the new, kick-starter funded console "Ouya".  The team at Agora Games is particularly excited about this new platform….read on to find out why!

 For those of you that don't know, Ouya is a new gaming console that is powered by Android.  It's whole purpose is not to replace existing consoles, but to open up your TV to games from all types of developers, professional and indie alike.  They are even building the console so that the hardware can be easily modded by "hackers".    The removing of these boundaries from a console is most definitely going to allow some amazing games to come to your TV that you would have otherwise never played.

 Yesterday, we received our Ouya dev kit in the mail, and immediately began uploading our own games.  We learned that not only does our new platform Hydra Mobile complement the Ouya model of being accessible to all developers, but it also is supported right out of the box!  We had our games running smoothly on our Ouya with profile stats, leaderboards, achievements & match-making.
