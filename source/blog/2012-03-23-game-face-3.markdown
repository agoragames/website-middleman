“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **brewscribe**

 Are you into brewing your own beer? Do you use Beersmith? Want to parse Beersmith2 (.bsmx) files in Ruby? Grab a pint of [brewscribe](https://github.com/cadwallion/brewscribe), or rather the gem, and enjoy!

 **factory-worker**

 [Factory Worker](https://github.com/agoragames/factory-worker) is our Node.js library that creates the Factory pattern for object stores. The 0.6.0 release integrates a pull request from GitHub user, [Szymon Nowak](https://github.com/szimek), to return the saved object from the Factory.create method.

 **darksky**

 Gray skies are gonna clear up, put on a happy face! Why? We've got 2 darksky-related releases this week. darksky continues to expand their [API](http://darkskyapp.com/api/) and they added two new endpoints: "brief_forecast" and "interesting". The 1.0.4 release of the [darksky](https://github.com/czarneckid/darksky) gem adds support for the "brief_forecast" endpoint. The "interesting" endpoint was supported as of the 1.0.3 release.

 **java-leaderboard **

 One of the [leaderboard](https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard) gem's spawn, [java-leaderboard](https://github.com/agoragames/java-leaderboard), saw a release with version 2.0.2 that integrates a pull request from GitHub user, [Jon Barber](https://github.com/sneakybeaky). His pull request added some logic to cope with cases where no such user is in the leaderboard. Thanks again Jon!

 **node-darksky**

 You want to integrate the darksky API into your Node.js application? Aaron Westendorf has you covered. He released version 0.1.0 of the [node-darksky](https://github.com/awestendorf/node-darksky) package last Saturday. And so, the darksky ecosystem got a little brighter!

 **vindicia-api**

 We use [Vincidia's CashBox](http://www.vindicia.com/CashBox) for SaaS billing in the [Major League Gaming store](http://store.majorleaguegaming.com/). A ruby gem that integrates with the Vincidia CashBox SOAP API doesn't do the development community any good if it's hidden away. So one of our engineers, Tom Quackenbush, polished off some rough edges and released version 0.0.2 of the [vindicia-api](https://github.com/agoragames/vindicia-api) gem.

 P.S. Totally unrelated, but Tom may also be working on a social network for cats called Kitty City. Stay tuned!
