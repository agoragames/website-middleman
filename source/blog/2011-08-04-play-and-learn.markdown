When I was in grade school, I had your typical learning experience. My teacher stood up in front of us everyday and lectured about something that I usually found utterly boring. Fast-forward to college and its still pretty much the same ordeal, except now there are more students. Having said that, you can understand the significant amount of envy that poured from my eyes as I read about the new ways that classes are being taught; one of which is video games. Imagine you went to school excited everyday because calculus was no longer your boring system of numbers and formulas. To add to it, you’ve also sparked a desire to learn because it now becomes a fun challenge. Well that’s the situation with these 6th graders who are learning via the Jason Experiment.

 Of course, gaming is still dominated by its entertainment persona, but today we’ve seen it evolve and disperse into several different categories. One of these is education. Nowadays, a simple Google search will easily lead you to sites that specialize in this area. We’ve also witnessed it make its way into the mobile phone section and become one of the benchmarks of its category list. Educational gaming has been an aid in the Jason project, which focuses on learning through interactivity. The concept has also been used to support learning of subjects like energy flow or even adult popular subjects like politics or finance. Residing in its early stages of practical, productive use, can you see gaming evolving to become sufficient in other aspects of society?
