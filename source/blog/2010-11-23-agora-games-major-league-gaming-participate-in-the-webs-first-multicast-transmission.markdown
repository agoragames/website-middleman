When you send a unicast message it gets routed within a network to a single destination.  Unlike unicast messages, multicast messages get delivered to every node within a network.  If not properly controlled however you can experience routing loops which, like feedback between a microphone and a speaker, cause what networking techs call "multicast storms".  Because of this many corporate networks block multicast messages from ever leaving a single broadcast domain.  For the same reason, multicast messages are blocked by all Internet Service Providers at the network's edge.

 Apparently it was just a matter of time until someone with a big enough backbone started letting them through.

 On November 12, 2010 during Major League Gaming's National Finals in Dallas we working with AT&T and Octoshape to deliver the first open-web multicast video stream.  Who doesn't love the bleeding edge?
