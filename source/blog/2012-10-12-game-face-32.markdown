“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **haigha**

 [haigha](https://github.com/agoragames/haigha) is our simple to use client library for interacting with AMQP brokers. The 0.5.8 release merges a number of pull requests for some example code as well as supressing a DeprecationWarning with the latest gevent.

 **leaderboard**

 [leaderboard](https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard/) allows you to build leaderboards using Redis. In the 2.5.0 release, we added members_from_rank_range and members_from_rank_range_in methods to be able to retrieve members from the leaderboard in a given rank range.
