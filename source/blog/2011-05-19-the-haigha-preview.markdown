Agora has released a preview of Haigha, its new Python client for Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). AMQP is a standardized application protocol for messaging middleware. Its purpose is to govern the behavior of the messaging provider and receiver to facilitate interoperability between vendors.

 Haigha is a descendant of py-amqplib, a common library used by the Python community. Haigha has been built from the ground up to use libevent for high performance IO while presenting a simple API that adheres to the form and function of the AMQP specification. It adds several useful features that simplify access to powerful AMQP idioms. By default, Haigha operates in a completely asynchronous mode, using callback-passing to trigger application code in response to AMQP events.
