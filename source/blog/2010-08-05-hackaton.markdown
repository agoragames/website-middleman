Working at MLG/Agora is pretty inspiring, and having the Wall Of Fame located directly opposite the door to my office continually reinforces my opinion. The wall's best feature is the newest team photo taken just after our recent Hackathon.

 What's a Hackathon you ask? It's eight teams, 24 hours, and the requirement to work on something, anything, so long as you have a working demo by the end of the event. The results? Four software products, three internal tools, two infrastructure improvements, one video-enabled conference room and a theme song for Hydra. Â A good time was had by all.
