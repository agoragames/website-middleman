title: 'Agora visits the University at Albany Career Fair '

Ernst and Young recruiters gave away silver pens, designer platinum-cased post it notes and travel coffee mugs. KPMG gave away environmentally friendly thermos bottles and key chains. They also had a really, really nice sign.

 Then there was Agora Games...
Being new to the recruiter role, Blake and I wore our beards and normal work attire, which included one mohawk and an obnoxious pair of florescent yellow Nikes. While perhaps not as sharp as other recruiter’s suits and ties, we were definitely dressed for success.

 The UAlbany Career fair saw hundreds of students from several degree programs trying to get a feel for which industries and companies were scouting future hires. As the university is known for its strong business school, we were offered numerous resumes from accounting, business administration and communications majors. A welcomed change of pace from our everyday engineering-focused mindset, it was interesting to chat with English majors, marketing majors, and the surprisingly frequent--and not surprisingly somewhat pushy--“my boyfriend plays video games all the time, can he work there?” career fair candidate.

 As interesting as this was, we were on a mission that was a bit more technically focused. Our goal: track down as many people as possible who were interested in Ruby on Rails, Python, JQuery, or Flash, while using our less than KPMG-worthy sign. We were given resumes from computer science  and information science majors, and information technology management buffs. Scouring the selection, scarcely did we find that "gem" we were looking for…literally, nobody knew what a Ruby Gem was. (har har!) All puns aside, we're continually finding this to be the case at most of the college career fairs we visit. In this university setting, to a polytechnic institute setting, (yes, reference intended), it seems that the most valuable coding language and most sought-after job skill in today’s software development field is concurrently the least taught.

 As we collected information on the student’s school-based skill sets, it was clear that the top engineer of tomorrow might also be the person who is learning coding languages on their own. Take heed, soon-to be-grads; spend a few weekends brushing up on some of the aforementioned languages. Scout outside the classroom walls to see what languages the smaller, innovative companies are using. Scour Craigslist to get a feel for what types of development work is being outsourced in your area. Who knows, you might see Blake and I at your upcoming career fair, mohawks and yellow sneakers adorned, looking for the next Ruby Wizard.
