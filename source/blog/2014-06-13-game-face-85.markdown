“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

I was going to use the excuse that we're still playing a bit of catch up since migrating our blog, but I've just been lazy :P

**activity_feed**

[activity_feed](https://github.com/agoragames/activity_feed) is a Ruby library for creating activity feeds or timelines backed by Redis. In the 3.1.0 release, we added a `trim_to_size(user_id, size, aggregate = ActivityFeed.aggregate)` method to trim activity feed to a certain number of items.

**chai**

[chai](https://github.com/agoragames/chai) provides a very easy to use api for mocking/stubbing your python objects, patterned after the [Mocha](http://mocha.rubyforge.org/) library for Ruby. As of 0.4.8, released this past week, we addressed PEP8 compliance as well as fixing an issue to [not pollute the global module namespace](https://github.com/agoragames/chai/issues/18).
