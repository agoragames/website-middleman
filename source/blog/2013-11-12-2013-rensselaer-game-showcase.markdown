Agora recently participated in the 2013 Rensselaer Game Showcase. The event, hosted annually by [RPI’s Game Dev Club](http://gamedev.union.rpi.edu/about/), provides an opportunity for both students and local hobbyists to display their games and network, while raising funds for [The Children’s Hospital at Albany Medical Center.](http://www.amc.edu/Patient/services/childrens_hospital/ch_video.cfm)

 In order to raise funds, attendees were encouraged to purchase an XP card and gain achievements by completing a task determined by exhibitors. Achievements could then be redeemed for reduced rates on snacks and games.

 Agora featured two of our most recent Hydra Pro integrated releases, Injustice: Gods Among Us and Saints Row IV. We offered two opportunities for achievements: complete one match of Injustice and search for a character on the Saints Row community webpage. Character searches included Mark Twain, Minion, Nicolas Cage, Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, and Mario, among others.
