title: 'It''s My Gem In A Box '

Hey developers, I got something real important to give you. So just sit down, and listen.



 We recently started a number of projects, each of which will require the use of a common library. So, here's how it went down:

 \* Create the common library as a gem using the [jeweler](http://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler) tool.

 \* Install [Gem in a Box](http://tomlea.co.uk/posts/gem-in-a-box/) to allow the gem to be downloaded internally by our developers using gem install.

 \* Upload the common library gem.

 BLAMMO! Now every developer can pull my gem ;)

 But seriously, "Gem in a Box" is awesome and a great way to share gems internally at your office.
