“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **kairos**

 [kairos](https://github.com/agoragames/kairos) provides time series storage using a Redis backend. kairos is intended to replace RRD in situations where the scale of Redis is required, with as few dependencies on other packages as possible. In the 0.1.2 release, we added support for relative time in terms of hours, days, weeks, months and years, support for simple transforms and an API for generic transforms to support statistics packages.

 **torus**

 [torus](https://github.com/agoragames/torus) is a service implementing the Carbon protocol to store time series data using [kairos](https://github.com/agoragames/kairos) and an HTTP server to query and analyze the data. It's a new project and compared to traditional disk stores such as RRD and Whisper, torus adds:

- abstraction on top of kairos for histograms, input and output processing
- compact storage for sparse data points
- scaling with per-schema hosting and sharding
- non-buffering semantics for aggregate processing
- consistent hashing of timestamps for ease in interleaving and interpolation
