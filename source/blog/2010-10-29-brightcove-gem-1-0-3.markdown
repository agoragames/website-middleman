I just pushed out version 1.0.3 of the [Brightcove gem](http://github.com/agoragames/brightcove). This version adds support for performing a file upload, which is useful if you need to create a video in [Brightcove](http://www.brightcove.com/). I did have to add a dependency for [Rest-Client](http://github.com/archiloque/rest-client) to support the multipart file upload. Thankfully it all just worked.
