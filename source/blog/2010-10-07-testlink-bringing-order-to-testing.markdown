If you start searching for test tracking and management software, you will run into Testlink. Although far from perfect, Testlink does some pretty cool things.  In the past, I kept track of my tests on proprietary software or open office spreadsheets, which are functional- but the organization offered by testlink moved my whole testing approach to a new level.



 **The Good:**

 Open Source

 Test case/requirements/test plan organization

 requirements management

 requirements based testing

 result reporting

 central location for assigning, approving and executing tests

 **The Bad:**

 It is a bit clunky to use

 UI is pretty horrible

 Minor bugs and unfinished features

 Isn't set up for a ton of integration- but there is an API

 **The results:**

 This tool opens up the testing process for anyone on the project to be aware of what QA is working on. Communication between QA and Devs can be improved (as everyone can access and review test cases or requirements), and the approval process is much easier and more organic than holding a big meeting. Test link has the potential for seamless integration with bug filing  helping to carefully order and maintain a tester's world. It doesn't come pre-linked to much, but the site does offer some instructions on setting it up yourself. It does offer a good user guide and a pretty active community for support.

 You can input your documents (I haven't found a way to do this automatically, but manually putting them in does ensure that you do careful ambiguity review) and then link each requirement to a test case, or generate test cases right from the requirement. The execute section can accept xml results and notes. Testlink automatically generates test plans and test reports with data from the system, so you can put out a document that shows your test plan, and then gives overviews of your test cases and tracks the requriements. It has been extremely useful for increasing transparency in the QA department and keeping everyone involved with the process. There is a way to create custom fields, which I have been used for test plan approvals and linking to bugs filed from the execute screen.

 In all, it is a great program- that could use some finishing tweaks and an UI overhaul. I can look past its flaws though for the functionality it provides. The functionality really is pretty cool. For multiple projects and teams, it makes organizing the test process easy.  Testlink is a great little program that can act as a hub for testing related activities.
