"Game Face" will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

**leaderboard**

[leaderboard](https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard/) allows you to build leaderboards using Redis. The leaderboard (Ruby), [leaderboard-python](https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-python) and [leaderboard-javascript](https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-coffeescript) libraries all saw updates this week. All 3 updates were to add support for the `change_score_for(...)` method in the `TieRankingLeaderboard` class.
