**UberStrike.com – Community Global Leaderboard**

Hydra Studio's user based Leaderboard service is now powering UberStrike's global leaderboard on their community website. This service enhances player connectivity by providing users with rankings based off of any stat a game is tracking on profiles. Additionally, Leaderboards increase a game's replay value by constantly challenging players to improve their skill.

**Hydra Studio Dashboard – Leaderboard Updates**

UberStrike currently provides a global leaderboard to players, but the CMUNE team has plans to implement in-game leaderboards and to expand their leaderboard offerings to include daily, weekly, and monthly rankings.

**Analytics**

Hydra Studio is automatically tracking the 17 million users playing UberStrike, individual player profile data, and other fundamental project statistics (total profiles, active users, and profile activity). This essential information not only provides developers with a quick snapshot of player engagement and retention, but drives game advancements by powering additional Hydra Studio services such as leaderboards.
