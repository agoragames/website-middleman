Hello again!

 We've had the wonderful opportunity to work with one of the best developers in the industry, Volition.  They are the great team of developers that have developed the popular "Saints Row" series.  Their most recent installment, named "Saints Row: The Third", continues this franchise in a big way.   Not only have they done a great job on the game, but they've integrated Hydra in way that perfectly supports their unique gameplay.  Addtitionally, their integration of Hydra has played a major role in the continued life of the game and its community well beyond its initial release.

 Interested in learning how they did it?
