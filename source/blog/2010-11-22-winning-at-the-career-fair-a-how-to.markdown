title: Winning at the Career Fair (A How-to)

Recently I had the pleasure of representing Agora Games at two Western New York career fairs held at RIT and my alma mater, University at Buffalo. It was a interesting experience to be on the flip side of the job search process for a change, sitting at our table answering questions, taking resumes, and evaluating applicants' skills to see if they might be the right fit for our team.

 One question that was asked repeatedly by fair-goers over the course of the two events was, 'What skills do I need, or what courses should I take, to be the best candidate to work at your company?'. This was a tough question to answer.

 The best answer that I could give was, 'There is no predefined skill-set. Today we are looking for Ruby on Rails developers, but tomorrow that may change. In a few months we may be looking for C++ or PHP or Flash devs depending on what we need at the time, so there's no real way to say.'

 To hear that probably sounds like a kick in the pants, like there's no way to prepare yourself, but the truth is that the software industry changes so fast that there really isn't any way to predict what technologies will be in style or what skills will be in demand tomorrow. However, there are things you can do to distinguish yourself from other candidates despite this ugly truth. I offered the following prescription:

 1. Release code.
 Find or start a project that you're excited about and contribute. It doesn't matter what language or framework, but just get something out there. The best candidates that we found were the ones that showed initiative and put forth extra effort in some little hobby project that they posted on sites like github.

 2. Get involved.
 Pick a conference or local user group on some topic that interests you and go! Conferences such as RailsConf, RubyConf, Game Developers Conference (GDC ), and even Penny Arcade Expo (PAX) offer great opportunities to meet and interact with like-minded developers. What could be more fun than hacking on a project together with your new friends? Maybe some of that code could even be released back into the community, or used as samples to show a future employer… hmm…

 In the end, the answer is to do what you love. If your goal is to code, then so do. Get involved and code. The code you produce, experience you gain, and connections you forge will have a beneficial side-effect of making you stand out in any future job search despite any new trend.
