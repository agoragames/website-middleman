Around this time last year, I was preparing to return to my internship with a fortune 50 company. However, the excitement that normally comes with such an accomplishment escaped me. The reason is because I knew exactly what to expect. I’d dress up in typical business attire and sit at my desk from 9-5, while waiting for the occasional computer crash or random fire drill. With so much to look forward to, who could complain, right?

 Wrong. When my last day came, I decided that I had officially retired the repetition, stress and boredom. After putting my best foot forward, I landed a job at Agora Games and things were completely different. I seemed to have entered an unfamiliar world, full of fun and exciting individuals with no limit to their creative potential. The plethora of randomness and the nature of our work, combined with the flexibility and surreal environment, formulated a culture that removed the work out of the job.

 On your first day at Agora, you will be set up at a new computer with a standard four-legged chair. I mention the chair’s regularity because it is then your prerogative to choose a new one from Staples. Your first course of action however, is to tour around the office for a company-wide meet and greet. Of course, no one expects that you’ll remember their name. Down the line, people will generally re-introduce themselves and try to get to know the family’s new addition.

 Like many, I place high value on self-expression. With that, I can proudly say that one of the biggest perks you’ll find at Agora is freedom.  This isn’t a bureaucratic work environment where you’ll get sanctioned for forgetting to tuck in your shirt.  Whether you want to dress like Prince or the old school New York Knicks players is up to you.

 Expect to find the necessary hierarchies and team divisions, which keep us organized and successful but you won’t be able to tell who’s who. Just yesterday a few of us went for ice cream with the CEO. We’re well structured which leads us to power projects like Guitar Hero, Call of Duty, or Mortal Kombat but at the same time, perfectly balanced to produce happier, more driven employees.

 To conclude this rant, I have a lot to look forward to and a lot to learn, but I also have an array of exciting individuals to learn from.  Additionally, with the constant stream of new challenges that keep me enticed, I couldn’t have chosen a better place to work.
