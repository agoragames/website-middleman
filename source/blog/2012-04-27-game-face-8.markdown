“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **kairos**

 [kairos](https://github.com/agoragames/kairos) is a library that provides time series storage using a Redis backend. The [0.0.6 release](https://github.com/agoragames/kairos/blob/master/CHANGELOG) added "optional compression on a series which will count unique hits on a value within an interval. Exact time resolution is traded in favor of a (possible) significant reduction in storage requirements. The resolution of the compression is up to the user in how they cast the data on insert."
