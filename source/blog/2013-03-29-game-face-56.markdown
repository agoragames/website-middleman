“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **forecast-ruby**

 [forecast-ruby](https://github.com/darkskyapp/forecast-ruby) is a [forecast.io](https://developer.darkskyapp.com/docs/v2) API wrapper in Ruby. [forecast.io](https://developer.darkskyapp.com/docs/v2) is the best weather service out there today and we're happy to have helped bring the Ruby wrapper to life.

 **hipchat-rb**

 [hipchat-rb](https://github.com/hipchat/hipchat-rb/) is the official Ruby gem for interacting with the HipChat service. This past week [a pull request was integrated](https://github.com/hipchat/hipchat-rb/pull/30) to only send HipChat notifications on capistrano deploys if the --dry-run (-n) was not passed.
