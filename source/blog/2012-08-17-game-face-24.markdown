“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **activity_feed**

 [activity_feed](https://github.com/agoragames/activity_feed) is our Ruby gem for storing and managing activity feeds in Redis. This week we added a full_feed method to be able to retrieve an entire activity feed. Use this method wisely, or rather, sparingly! This is available in activity_feed 2.1.0.

 **chai**

 [chai](https://github.com/agoragames/chai) - provides a very easy to use api for mocking/stubbing your python objects, patterned after the [Mocha](http://mocha.rubyforge.org/) library for Ruby. The 0.1.23 release updates side_effect to be called with the arguments of the method call if it doesn't define its own arguments.

 **haigha**

 [haigha](https://github.com/agoragames/haigha) is our simple to use client library for interacting with AMQP brokers. The 0.5.5 release fixes a bug in the gevent transport.

 **php-bracket_tree**

 [bracket_tree](https://github.com/agoragames/bracket_tree) is a bracketing system built around the BracketTree Data Specification, which uses a three-section data structure built on top of JSON to convey the visual representation, progression logic, and seed mapping in a serializable format. [php-bracket_tree](https://github.com/agoragames/php-bracket_tree) is a PHP port of the original Ruby library.
