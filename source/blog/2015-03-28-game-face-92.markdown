"Game Face" will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

**handlebars.rb**

[handlebars.rb](https://github.com/cowboyd/handlebars.rb) is a set of Ruby bindings for Handlebars.js. One of our engineers, Matt Wilson, is now a maintainer of the project.

**leaderboard**

[leaderboard](https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard/) allows you to build leaderboards using Redis. The leaderboard (Ruby) and [leaderboard-python](https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-python) libraries were updated this week to fix an issue with the `TieRankingLeaderboard` class, to allow for member data to be passed to the `change_score_for(...)` method, and to add an `:include_missing` option in leaderboard request options to change whether or not to include missing members in the result.

**nginx Google OAuth**

[nginx-google-oauth](https://github.com/agoragames/nginx-google-oauth) is a Lua module to add Google OAuth to nginx. We released version 1.1.0 this week which integrates a pull request for security and usability enhancements.

**stache**

[stache](https://github.com/agoragames/stache) is our Rails 3.x and Rails 4.x compatible Mustache/Handlebars Template Handler, with support for partials and a couple extra niceties to make sharing the raw templates with client-side javascript a little easier. The 1.1.1 release includes gugfixes from many new contributors and some expanded test coverage!
