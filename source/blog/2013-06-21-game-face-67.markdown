“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **confirm-with-reveal**

 [confirm-with-reveal](https://github.com/agoragames/confirm-with-reveal) is a replacement for window.confirm() using the Reveal modal popup plugin from Zurb Foundation. In the release we did on 2013-06-18, we added localization for the UI text via configuration variable.

 **haigha**

 [haigha](https://github.com/agoragames/haigha) is our simple to use client library for interacting with AMQP brokers. We addressed an issue in the 0.5.11 release of writing headers if the type of a field is a subclass of the supported native types.
