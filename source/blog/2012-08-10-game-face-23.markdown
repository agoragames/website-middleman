“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 [bnet_scraper](https://github.com/agoragames/bnet_scraper/) is our Nokogiri-based scraper of Battle.net profiles. The 0.2.1 release fixes a race condition for profile scraping for accounts playing in their first season.

 **strumbar**

 [strumbar](https://github.com/agoragames/strumbar) is a wrapper around ActiveSupport::Notifications with preconfigurations for basic instrumentation to be sent to statsd. This week we've fixed a critical issue in the built-in Redis instrumentation and added configuration options to explicitly load the desired built-in or custom instrumentations, as well as set the desired sample rate for each.
