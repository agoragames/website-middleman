“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **bnet_scraper**

 [bnet_scraper](https://github.com/agoragames/bnet_scraper) is our Nokogiri-based scraper of Battle.net profiles. 0.1.0 was released today and replaces open-uri with Faraday. The other change is that a BnetScraper::InvalidProfileError is raised when unsuccessfully scraping.

 **streak**

 [streak](https://github.com/czarneckid/streak) is a gem for calculating win/loss streaks. The most recent 0.3.0 release encompasses a number of changes to use Redis hashes to store its data as well as being able to pass a custom set of keys to be used in the aggregate call if you want to track streaks on a different set of positive/negative things than what is setup in the configuration.
