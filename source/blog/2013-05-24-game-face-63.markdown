“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **chai**

 [chai](https://github.com/agoragames/chai) provides a very easy to use api for mocking/stubbing your python objects, patterned after the [Mocha](http://mocha.rubyforge.org/) library for Ruby. We've had a few rapid fire releases to try and address Python 3 compatibility. chai 0.3.4 incorporates the following:

- Further fixed global namespace manipulation on test class hierarchies
- Expectations with a type argument are matched against either an instance of that type, or the type itself
- Removed unittest2 requirement and termcolor requirement, fixes https://github.com/agoragames/chai/issues/5

 **torus**

 [torus](https://github.com/agoragames/torus) is a service implementing the Carbon protocol to store time series data using [kairos](https://github.com/agoragames/kairos) and an HTTP server to query and analyze the data. torus 0.3.2 incorporates the following changes:
- Fixed handling of "condensed" and "interval" parameters to "/series"
- Fixed handling of "start" and "end" parameters to "/series"
