title: Up and running with Zappa, Coffeescript & Mongoose

At [Major League Gaming](http://www.majorleaguegaming.com) we recently launched an internal profile service using NodeJS. In an effort to get more familiar with Node, I decided to use it on my latest personal project. In addition, since CoffeeScript is now included out of the box in Rails 3.1 I decided it was time to try that too. Here's a simple app to get you up and running with [Node](http://www.nodejs.org), [Zappa](http://www.zappajs.org), [Coffeescript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) & [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/).



 To get it working:

- Install MongoDB
- Install NodeJS
- Install NPM
- npm install -g mongoose
- npm install -g zappa
- Run the gist 'coffee file.coffee'
