It is that time of year again, the annual migration of game developers to GDC in San Francisco, and Agora Games will be in attendance.

2013 was an exciting year for the Hydra Team. We added a ton of features to our Hydra portfolios and we can't wait to show them off. Whether you are an existing user, or would like to learn more about what we do, we welcome the opportunity to meet with you. Please review our conference attendance schedule below, and reach out to us to set up a meeting.
