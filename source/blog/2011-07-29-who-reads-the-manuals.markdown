title: Who Reads the Manuals?

So I recently ordered my own copy of Mortal Kombat and it arrived just a few days ago. Once in my impatient hands, I savagely tore open its containing box without a fragment of mercy; ending with something similar to this:

 After that, I proceeded to remove the inferior plastic barrier that stood between me and the future of gory deaths that I’d be responsible for. Having taken care of the plastic with my razor sharp teeth, I pried open the casing open to reveal a fairly well decorated DVD and a booklet on the side. Naturally the booklet never experienced the faintest drop of my attention, but the DVD was pampered with the greatest of care. I removed it from its casing, popped it into my PS3 and enjoyed the awkwardly menacing side of me that enjoyed achieving the bloodiest of fatalities.

 Today, with most things, you normally learn as you go along. Somehow, I find myself remembering how I use to value those little booklets that I now show no love to. In the past, before delicately removing the DVD, I would have carefully removed the manual and used it to avoid the learning curve. Now, I realize that it had been a long time since I had read a game manual and will probably be an even longer time before I read another one. So I wonder, are game manuals worth it or have they become a waste of our limited resources? I personally think they should be available on the website or on the game disk. Of course, I haven’t ruled out that I may be the only one who doesn’t care for the manuals, so let me know your thoughts on our [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/agoragames) or below!
