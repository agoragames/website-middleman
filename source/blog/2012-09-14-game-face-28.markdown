“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games. Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our [Agora Games GitHub](https://github.com/agoragames/) account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…

 **amico**

 [amico](https://github.com/agoragames/amico) is our Ruby gem for managing relationships (e.g. friendships) backed by Redis. The 2.3.1 release simply wrapped a few operations in Redis multi/exec blocks to be consistent with the rest of the library.

 **chai**

 [chai](https://github.com/agoragames/chai) – provides a very easy to use api for mocking/stubbing your python objects, patterned after the [Mocha](http://mocha.rubyforge.org/) library for Ruby. In the 0.2.2 release, UnexpectedCall is now a BaseException which is re-raised as an AssertionError in Chai metaclass `test_wrapper` method. This decreases the chance that UnexpectedCall will be caught by the application code being tested.

 **vindicia-api**

 [vindicia-api](https://github.com/agoragames/vindicia-api/) is a wrapper for creating queries to the Vindicia CashBox API. While we had open sourced the code about 6 months ago, we forgot to cut a gem release to RubyGems. This is just an FYI that you can now find the [vindicia-api on RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/vindicia-api).
