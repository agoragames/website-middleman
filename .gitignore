# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
# git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# Ignore bundler config
/.bundle

# Ignore the build directory
/build

# Ignore cache
/.sass-cache
/.cache

# Ignore .DS_Store file
.DS_Store

# Ignore packages installed by Node
/node_modules

# Ordinarily, I'd say we'd want to ignore packages installed by Bower, but I
# don't think Jenkins is going to run `bower install` for us, so for now we
# have to commit the Foundation vendor stuff into the repo.
#
# /bower_components
