In a number of projects we've done here at Agora Games, we've used queues to make that happen. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/redis/">Redis</a> has been on my radar for awhile now, but yesterday I drove my Chevy to the levee and guess what? The levee is NOT dry people. I mean, who drinks rye anyway these days? Old people.</p> <p>Right, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/redis/">Redis</a>.</p> <p>"Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is similar to memcached but the dataset is not volatile, and values can be strings, exactly like in memcached, but also lists, sets, and ordered sets. All this data types can be manipulated with atomic operations to push/pop elements, add/remove elements, perform server side union, intersection, difference between sets, and so forth. Redis supports different kind of sorting abilities."</p> <p>I was particularly interested in the support in Redis for lists, which would allow me to have one application push stuff into the datastore and allow for another application to pull stuff from the datastore. A datastore that could operate as a queue? I guess this is as close as we're going to get to flying cars in 2010. Redis is also supposed to be wicked fast and there are a number of libraries available in your programming language of choice with which to communicate with Redis.</p> <p>Redis setup was trivial and "just worked".</p> <p>After starting the Redis server, I could just prototype in script/console.</p> <p>Here we go:</p> <p><code>ruby &gt;&gt; redis_queue = Redis.new =&gt; #&lt;Redis:0x222df9c @thread_safe=nil, @logger=nil, @password=nil, @timeout=5, @db=0, @sock=nil, @host="127.0.0.1", @port=6379&gt; &gt;&gt; redis_queue.push_tail 'strings', 'string 1' =&gt; "OK" &gt;&gt; redis_queue.push_tail 'strings', 'string 2' &gt;&gt; "OK" &gt;&gt; redis_queue.list_length('strings') =&gt; 2 &gt;&gt; redis_queue.list_range('strings', 0, -1) =&gt; ["string 1", "string 2"] &gt;&gt; some_string = redis_queue.pop_head('strings') =&gt; "string 1" &gt;&gt; r.list_range('strings', 0, -1) =&gt; ["string 2"] &gt;&gt; r.list_length('strings') =&gt; 1 &gt;&gt; quit </code></p> <p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/CommandReference">There are quite a few commands that make Redis even more awesome, but for now I'm sold</a>. (If using an entire sentence as a link is wrong then I don't want to be right)</p> <p>Also, I know of <a href="http://github.com/defunkt/resque#readme">Resque</a>, "a Redis-backed library for creating background jobs, placing those jobs on multiple queues, and processing them later." If I ever feel like driving the Mercedes Benz of flying cars, I'll use it.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Feb 23 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2010/02/23/watching-trees/">Watching Trees</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Jason LaPorte</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>As a SysAdmin, my job more-or-less exists by knowing miscellaneous arcana that most software engineers aren't aware of.</p> <p>When a particular co-worker here at Agora has a problem with his Linux machine, I provide advice and show him how to fix it. Some months after he had joined Agora, I discovered that after each troubleshooting session, he copy-and-pastes the entire text terminal log into a text file that he keeps on his desktop. He has dozens of transcripts at this point; I bet if I were to look through it, it would read something like the Tao te Ching or Bhagavad Gita, only concerning UNIX instead of right living.</p> <p>(Of course, there's not much of a difference between UNIX and right living, but that's a topic for another day.)</p> <p>In the spirit of allowing you to build your own little collection, here is a simple trick that came in handy to me yesterday.</p> <p>Last night, the cron jobs powering one of our managed sites stopped running. I had stopped them, cleaned up, and restarted them, but I wanted to watch the system and see if they had started running again so I could monitor that they were doing their job.</p> <p>UNIX has a well-known command called " <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/top">top</a>," which shows superlative processes running on your system: which ones are consuming the most CPU time, which ones are consuming the most RAM, which ones have been running the longest, and so on. It's a very useful tool, but if you're trying to track down processes over time that don't necessarily consume very many resources, then it's not the tool you're looking for.</p> <p>However, our Linux distribution (and, indeed, most others) provide a useful graphical tool for mapping the current state of the system: " <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/pstree">pstree</a>." This command will give you a list of processes (much like the " <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/ps">ps</a>" command), except that instead of generating a list, it will draw a little tree showing the state of the system. This is perfect for seeing exactly what is going on: which daemons are running, who is on the system and what they're executing, and so on. However, it doesn't show you what is happening over time; it merely lists what is happening at this moment.</p> <p>However, our Linux distribution (and, indeed, most others) provides yet another useful tool: " <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/watch">watch</a>." It runs a program every 2 seconds (by default) and displays the result to your screen. This allows you to make a ghetto clock by writing something like "watch <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/date">date</a>;" in our case, we could make a ghetto graphical "top" by writing the simple "watch pstree." You can now watch your virtual trees rustle in the wind.</p> <p>It kept us on top of the cron job, and things were back to normal in no time.</p> <p>For more information, RTFM. :)</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Feb 22 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2010/02/22/and-now-for-some-couchdb/">And now for some couchdb</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Jason LaPorte</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>I had occasion tonight to give a quick demo of CouchDB.  This is so simple its almost not worth blogging about, but hey, good software is <strong><em>supposed</em></strong> to be simple.</p> <p><strong>Install</strong> On your Mac:</p> <p><code> sudo port install couchdb sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.couchdb.plist </code></p> <p>On Ubuntu:</p> <p><code> sudo apt-get install couchdb </code></p> <p>You're done; now to play.</p> <p><strong>Futon Admin Interface</strong> This allows you to create a DB, create records, etc.</p> <ol> <li>Open http://localhost:5984/_utils/</li> <li>…</li> <li>Prosper</li> </ol> <p><strong>Using our old friend <em>curl</em></strong></p> <p><code> curl -X PUT http://localhost:5984/mlg/ #create a db curl -X GET http://localhost:5984/mlg/ #get a whole bunch of info about the db curl -X POST http://localhost:5984/mlg/ -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{"body": "Here is a paragraph"}' #create a record </code></p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jan 29 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2010/01/29/getting-started-with-data_fabric/">Getting started with data_fabric</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>The <a href="http://github.com/mperham/data_fabric">data_fabric</a> gem "provides flexible database connection switching for ActiveRecord". If you're not concerned with database sharding, you might want to skip this blog post. Or not. Either way, I'm not going to be offended.</p> <p>I have a requirement that certain data in an application that I'm developing will probably have to be sharded because, if you'll excuse my English, there will a "shit ton" of data. This only affects one model out of the few models I have in the application. I don't have a requirement that the data will be replicated (which is another feature supported in <code>data_fabric</code>), so I'm not going into that here. In any event, here is a rundown of how I got started developing and testing with <code>data_fabric</code>.</p> <ul> <li>Configure the <code>data_fabric</code> gem in your <code>config/environment.rb</code> file.</li> </ul> <p><code>ruby config.gem 'data_fabric' </code></p> <ul> <li>In your model(s), decide on which column or how the data is going to be shared.</li> </ul> <p><code>ruby data_fabric :replicated =&gt; false, :shard_by =&gt; :initial_code </code></p> <p>In this case, inital_code is a method that looks at a piece of the model's data and gives me the correct shard.</p> <ul> <li>Setup the database shards in your <code>config/database.yml</code> file. I actually setup only one shard for development and testing environments to make things easier. I'm just including the one for the test environment here. You can read on the <code>data_fabric</code> site about the naming convention for sharded database connections.</li> </ul> <p>```yaml test: adapter: mysql encoding: utf8 reconnect: false database: myapp_test pool: 5 username: root password:</p> <h1 id=this-is-the-database-shard>This is the database shard</h1> <p>initial_code_testenv_test: adapter: mysql encoding: utf8 reconnect: false database: myapp_test_testenv pool: 5 username: root password: ```</p> <ul> <li>In <code>config/initializers/my_app_model.rb</code>, I actually stub out the initial_code method to return a single value for the development and test environments. This is merely convenience so I don't have to include every single database shard for development and testing.</li> </ul> <p>```ruby require 'mocha'</p> <p>if 'development'.eql?(RAILS_ENV) PromotionCode.stubs(:initial_code).returns('devenv') end</p> <p>if 'test'.eql?(RAILS_ENV) PromotionCode.stubs(:initial_code).returns('testenv') end ```</p> <ul> <li>I copied part of the Rakefile from the <code>data_fabric</code> gem to actually be able to migrate the database for the sharded database connections. This was definitely missing from the <code>data_fabric</code> README.</li> </ul> <p>```ruby require 'fileutils' include FileUtils::Verbose</p> <p>namespace :db do task :migrate do require 'erb' require 'logger' require 'active_record'</p> <pre><code>reference = YAML::load(ERB.new(IO.read("config/database.yml")).result)
env = RAILS_ENV = ENV['RAILS_ENV'] || 'development'

ActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
ActiveRecord::Base.logger.level = Logger::WARN
ActiveRecord::Base.configurations = reference.dup
old_config = reference[env]
reference.each_key do |name|
  next unless name.include? env
  next if name.include? 'slave' # Replicated databases should not be touched directly

  puts "Migrating #{name}"
  ActiveRecord::Base.clear_active_connections!
  ActiveRecord::Base.configurations[env] = reference[name]
  ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection RAILS_ENV
  ActiveRecord::Migration.verbose = ENV["VERBOSE"] ? ENV["VERBOSE"] == "true" : true
  ActiveRecord::Migrator.migrate("db/migrate/", ENV["VERSION"] ? ENV["VERSION"].to_i : nil)
end   end end ```
</code></pre> <ul> <li>In my test classes that use the sharded model, I have setup and teardown methods that activate and deactivate the shard.</li> </ul> <p>```ruby def setup DataFabric.activate_shard(:initial_code =&gt; 'testenv') end</p> <p>def teardown MyAppModel.delete_all DataFabric.deactivate_shard(:initial_code =&gt; 'testenv') end ```</p> <p>I did find that I needed to delete all the objects in the database for the sharded model. I'm still digging into why that's the case. My ActiveRecord_fu isn't that strong I guess.</p> <p>All in all, sharding is relatively easy with data_fabric. Pimping, however, "ain't easy." But that's for another blog post I guess.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jan 15 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2010/01/15/i-am-git-and-so-can-you/">I Am Git (And So Can You!)</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>It's amazing how a few months can change your mindset around the version control system you use. Ever since I joined Agora Games in May 2008, we have used Subversion (SVN). Subversion is a fine version control system. We have one new project using Subversion and we will probably have a few legacy projects that will always use Subversion. However, last year, one of our project teams made the switch to Git and ever since then, new projects have been using Git.</p> <p>Looking at CruiseControl, here's the breakdown of Subversion and Git projects:</p> <p>Subversion: 4</p> <p>Git: 7</p> <p>Here is what I found personally about my Git transition experience.</p> <ul> <li>If you look at the simple examples or cursory blog post introductions of using Git as a version control system, you're probably not going to switch. I didn't find those examples or Git blog posts enlightening at all. I just thought to myself, "Great, Git can track changes to files just like Subversion, so why should I switch?".</li> <li>Git is something I can use independent of a service like GitHub locally to implement version control on projects that might never make it off of my machine.</li> <li>Git can be taken to the extreme where every "change" can be separated from the main branch of development and then merged at a later point. At Agora, we've taken a more balanced approach where major features go into a new branch and then are reviewed and merged back into the main branch, after which the new branch can be safely removed (e.g. replacing an authentication system).</li> <li>Although tools like <a href="http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/index.html">SmartGit</a> exist, I needed to get comfortable by using Git from the command-line.</li> <li>There are a lot of Git commands and capabilities I haven't used yet, and that's OK.</li> <li>I love the idea of the Git stash, where you can scurry away local changes and revert to a clean working directory, but then recover those changes later.</li> </ul> <p>Git is just something you need to try. I'm no expert in Git (yet). Git's barrier to entry feels very minimal when compared to other version control systems.</p> <p>P.S. I realize this blog post falls under the "cursory blog post introductions of using Git as a version control system" category. Whatever.</p> <p>:)</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jan 4 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2010/01/04/scaling-ruby-and-rails-part-1/">Scaling Ruby and Rails Part 1</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>I wish scaling applications and systems these days consisted solely of " <a href="http://olabini.com/blog/2008/05/just-add-scaling/">Just Add Scaling!</a>". But you know what? It's not. I also forget where I read it, but the quote went something like, "Programming languages don't scale, architectures scale." Scaling is driven by proper iterative design, implementation and testing.</p> <p>In a series of blog posts I want to cover how we have approached scaling out various parts of our Ruby and Rails infrastructure here at Agora Games using real-world examples on very high-traffic sites such as the Guitar Hero and Call of Duty community sites.</p> <p>Here I'll cover the "Deep Dive". I originally came from BigCo. and there we used a concept called the "Deep Dive", which involved taking a specific requirement in combination with an approach or technology and following a thread of execution that would take you through the entire technology stack, or a "deep dive" through the system. At the end you would either prove or disprove the technology or approach. But it was done in the context of a real set of requirements.</p> <p>The following is the e-mail (project/features names changed to protect the innocent … the important concept here is the Deep Dive, not the project/features) I sent around to our engineering team in September of last year after doing a Deep Dive on a queue system.</p> <hr/> <blockquote> <p>From: David Czarnecki</p> </blockquote> <p>To: Engineering</p> <p>Clearly Defined Requirement(s)</p> <p>Ultimately, to do a deep dive correctly, you need clearly defined requirements to evaluate your technology or approach against. In the case of PROJECT X, with the use of a queue, we had the following:</p> <p>Setup queue Decide event(s) Send to queue Aggregate from/to queue Put into message creation Send back to the app</p> <p>Narrowing the Field</p> <p>I spent a day looking at various queue packages in Ruby and other languages to understand:</p> <p>Features - What features do we get out of the package? API - How easy is it to setup/create/interact with the queue from actual code? Aliveness - Is this an ongoing effort or was it thrown on RubyForge and ultimately abandoned? Community - Where is this package being used? How many developers or contributors commit to the project? Language - Are we expanding our technology stack by introducing a queue written in one language with an interface in another language?</p> <p>Pork, aka The Other Other Requirements</p> <p>And don't forget about the other "unspoken" requirements.</p> <p>Ease of setup Speed Failsafe Scaling</p> <p>At the end of the day, whichever package is picked, you want some guarantee that the package you've chosen is "good" or at least "good enough". But what if the Guarantee Fairy's a crazy glue sniffer? Next thing you know there's change missing from your dresser and your daughter's knocked up. I've seen it a hundred times. Although you've got a set of requirements that define how you're going to use a technology or approach operationally, there are still requirements that need to be addressed, even if there isn't anything formally specified.</p> <p>Let's Get Ready To Rumble</p> <p>I chose Sparrow and Rabbit/AMQP since these passed the "ease of setup" requirements with flying colors.</p> <p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/sparrow/">http://code.google.com/p/sparrow/</a> - Pure Ruby</p> <p><a href="http://hopper.squarespace.com/blog/2008/7/22/simple-amqp-library-for-ruby.html">http://hopper.squarespace.com/blog/2008/7/22/simple-amqp-library-for-ruby.html</a></p> <p>Erlang Queue Server/Ruby interface to Queue</p> <p>Next up it was time to prove out the feasibility of the two technologies looking at the "soft" requirements in the context of the "hard" requirements. This meant setting up the two systems to:</p> <p>Setup queue Send event(s) to queue Aggregate from/to queue</p> <p>The other "hard" requirements would be addressed based on the outcome of this initial sanity check.</p> <p>2 Queues Enter, 1 Queue Leaves … Wait, what?</p> <p>Although I wanted to use this to prove out "FEATURE X", I also wanted to address its use in "FEATURE Y". "FEATURE Y" involves converting a song file into an MP3. So I setup a test to evaluate the two systems which was:</p> <p><code>ruby 1k, 8k, 16k, 32k, 64k messages do 25.times do 10000 messages do publish message to queue read message from queue end end end </code></p> <p>In other words, publish 10000 messages to the queue (in one process) and read those messages from the queue (in another process), noting how long it took to publish and read. Do this 25 times to get a min/max/average time for each of the different message sizes.</p> <p>I have attached the spreadsheet of the results which show: the larger the message, the longer it takes to publish and read from the queue. However, it also shows that Sparrow could handle the 64k messages while Rabbit/AMQP could not. Sparrow got slower to process those 10000 64k items from the queue, but it never failed as with Rabbit/AMQP. Ultimately, the deep dive was not about fixing a broken AMQP adapter.</p> <p>The Devil is in the Details</p> <p>One benefit of using Sparrow is that persistence is built into the server. If you take down Sparrow and there are messages on the queue, it will write those out to an SQLite3 database. Ultimately this lead me to look at the size of the field it was using for queue data which would need to be patched from its current 255 characters.</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>So, I've now got a queue server that I feel comfortable setting up and using and that can probably handle the load of data we're going to throw at it come launch. The queue server/queues were integrated into PROJECT X in the context of the "FEATURE X" to prove its feasibility in addressing that feature in a future sprint.</p> <p>And one more thing …</p> <p>There are tests for the various bits that make up "FEATURE X". I'm most happy with the integration test which fires up a Sparrow server, fires up a foo, creates a bar, runs the aggregator, and checks to see that a baz was created for the account (oh and then cleaning up the queue server and the subscriber). 14 LOC, but there's a lot of code that it exercises behind the scenes. And yes, it passes :) <strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong>_____</p> <p>So, there you go. Hopefully you have enough information to do your own Deep Dive.</p> <p>Ultimately for FEATURE X and FEATURE Y, Sparrow more than met our needs. Advances and changes to AMQP and its associated libraries have been made which I'm sure make it a more than viable candidate. At the time however, with just getting the system to work for a day to prove out the Deep Dive, it just didn't meet our needs.
