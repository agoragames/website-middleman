<p><strong>chai</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/chai">chai</a> provides a very easy to use api for mocking/stubbing your python objects, patterned after the <a href="http://mocha.rubyforge.org/">Mocha</a> library for Ruby. This week we released chai 1.0.0. chai 1.0.0 added spies, a variation of an expectation that asserts a call has happened.</p>

<p><strong>sidekiq-failures</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mhfs/sidekiq-failures">sidekiq-failures</a> "keeps track of Sidekiq failed jobs and adds a tab to the Web UI to let you browse them." We submitted a pull request to <a href="https://github.com/mhfs/sidekiq-failures/pull/89">add the paging links to the bottom of a page of failures</a>.</p>

<p><strong>stache</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/stache">stache</a> is our Rails 3.x and Rails 4.x compatible Mustache/Handlebars Template Handler, with support for partials and a couple extra niceties to make sharing the raw templates with client-side javascript a little easier. In the stache 1.1.0 release, we accepted a pull request to <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/stache/pull/43">cache compiled templates between requests</a>. You may see a 200-300% boost in rendering performance.</p>

<p><strong>leaderboard</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard/">leaderboard</a> allows you to build leaderboards using Redis. The leaderboard (Ruby), <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-python">leaderboard-python</a> and <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-coffeescript">leaderboard-coffeescript</a> libraries all saw updates a few weeks ago. In leaderboard 3.7.0, we added <code>TieRankingLeaderboard</code> and <code>CompetitionRankingLeaderboard</code> classes to handle ties in leaderboards. Specifics on ranking between those 2 different leaderboards are described in the <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard#alternate-leaderboard-types">alternate leaderboard types</a> documentation. This same functionality was ported to leaderboard-python 3.0.0 and leaderboard-coffeescript 1.8.0.</p>

<p><strong>Kafka Scripts</strong></p>

<p>Andrew implemented a simple utility allowing users to view filtered subsets of Hydra Studio API traffic (request response pairs). Filtering is done by request time window, environment, and API key as well as request processing time and response HTTP status code. This tool can be used to tail traffic as it occurs as well as view historical traffic via a unified interface. It's a simple program that is around 100 lines of Python reading messages from a Kafka topic.</p>

<p><strong>Oculus Unity Demo + Hydra</strong></p>

<p>John worked on getting familiar with Agora's Hydra Studio features as well as our Unity SDK. Looking through the Unity store there's a lot of services similar to ours integrated into the Unity demo projects to help developers get an idea of how to use them. Following this pattern he took the 2D example project and started integrating Hydra features into it.</p>

<p><strong>Hydra UI for Achievements</strong></p>

<p>Nick worked on making a customizable yet easy to use achievement system for the Hydra SDK for Unity3d. It was made with Unity's Editor Script, so users can adjust all kinds of settings (Display time, color, trophy/picture) without looking at any code. Proof of concept as to what tools for unity can be made once Hydra Studio comes out of beta.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://i821.photobucket.com/albums/zz136/agoragames/5bd24381-110e-449f-b75b-fe415a02bdd9_zpsdd814119.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Tournament Seeding Gem UI</strong></p>

<p>Matt worked on a plain-ruby library for managing and tracking multi-round tournaments. It knows about two types of tournament structures right now (random pairing and swiss pairing), with the promise of more to come, via bracket-tree and a couple swiss variations. You can customize various things about the tournament and also track player metadata, so it should be pretty easy to serialize data to and from.</p>

<p>Next steps are a more formal data serialization layer and cleaning up some known edge cases (mostly around byes) in the current code, then wrapping bracket_tree to handle elimination style tourneys.</p>

<p>It’s not open source yet, but it will be once he has cleaned up the codebase.</p>

<p><strong>Text Web Game (MUD)</strong></p>

<p>David A. worked on a text-based, RPG style, game with Hydra integration. You can play it <a href="http://mvdavid7.github.io/text-adventure/">here</a>.</p>

<p>It is written in Dart, and compiled to javascript.</p>

<p>It uses the following Hydra features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Match Templates: Store metadata about how to generate maps</li>
  <li>Matches: Store map data in the match</li>
  <li>Profiles: Save basic stats</li>
  <li>Achievements: Display achievements for the logged in user</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Lua for OAuth</strong></p>

<p>Aaron finished extracting last hack-a-thon hacks into a legit project, adding most of the features and documentation a user would need to add Google OAuth to their nginx hosts, available <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/nginx-google-oauth">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Tie Handling in Leaderboard Libraries</strong></p>

<p>David Cz. worked on tie handling in the <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-python">Python</a> and <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-coffeescript">JavaScript</a> leaderboard libraries. Two types of tie handling are now supported, Tie Ranking and Competition Ranking. In Tie Ranking, you define a leaderboard where members with the same score are given the same rank. In Competition Ranking, you define a leaderboard where members with the same score will have the same rank, and then a gap is left in the ranking numbers. The documentation for each of the libraries goes into more detail on what the tie rankings look like.</p>

<p><strong>Confirm with Reveal Bug</strong></p>

<p>Jack fixed a bug with Agora's open-source "confirm-with-reveal" JavaScript plugin that stopped it from working with Rails' unobtrusive JavaScript jQuery plugin.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/confirm-with-reveal/issues/9">here</a> for details/commit.</p>

<p>He also made some progress toward extending that plugin to allow users to provide an existing popup already on the page as the confirmation dialog, rather than using one generated by the plugin.</p>

<p><strong>HTML/CSS</strong></p>

<p>Brett used the day to learn the basics of HTML and CSS using codeacademy. He made a really simple HTML file and a simple CSS file to show off a little bit of what he learned.</p>

<p>I was going to use the excuse that we're still playing a bit of catch up since migrating our blog, but I've just been lazy :P</p>

<p><strong>activity_feed</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/activity_feed">activity_feed</a> is a Ruby library for creating activity feeds or timelines backed by Redis. In the 3.1.0 release, we added a <code>trim_to_size(user_id, size, aggregate = ActivityFeed.aggregate)</code> method to trim activity feed to a certain number of items.</p>

<p><strong>chai</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/chai">chai</a> provides a very easy to use api for mocking/stubbing your python objects, patterned after the <a href="http://mocha.rubyforge.org/">Mocha</a> library for Ruby. As of 0.4.8, released this past week, we addressed PEP8 compliance as well as fixing an issue to <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/chai/issues/18">not pollute the global module namespace</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Open Source Updates/Plugin Work</strong> - <a href="http://youtu.be/ao-TzdjR4Fk">Presentation</a></p>

<p>Jack updated Agora's open-source <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/confirm-with-reveal">confirm-with-reveal plugin</a> with some new features, including additional customization options for the HTML UI, and JavaScript events hooks on confirmation and cancellation of user prompts. </p>

<p><strong>OAuth Support and Misc. Repo Updates</strong> - <a href="http://youtu.be/fF5o7GPbjzU">Presentation</a></p>

<p>Aaron used Lua to integrate Google Apps OAuth into nginx so that Agora has centralized authentication for all of our tools. </p>

<p><strong>Load Test Chart Enhancements</strong> - <a href="http://youtu.be/BbX4D50K3xI">Presentation</a></p>

<p>David A. worked on a javascript wrapper around the Google Visualization API to better support overlaying multiple data sets, available <a href="http://mvdavid7.github.io/google-viz-plus/">here</a>. It allows users to hide and show lines after the graph is rendered and to group lines by any number of axes. </p>

<p><strong>Hydra Support Website</strong> - <a href="http://youtu.be/cPSvNRww4Qk">Presentation</a></p>

<p>Elliott completed the next evolution of the Hydra Support website. With the Hydra Studio platform becoming more popular and well known to game developers, the amount of Hydra Studio support tickets that come into Agora on a weekly basis have greatly increased. Where as prior to the March 28th Hackathon, our support website was heavily weighted towards Hydra Pro support (with a small amount of Hydra Studio support), Elliott's Hackathon work moved to strike a more suitable balance between Hydra Pro &amp; Hydra Studio support. Hydra Studio now has it's own dedicated discussion forums (broken out by features), and our knowledge-base has been updated to include all of the most relevant Hydra Studio feature &amp; documentation updates from the past four months. We still have the base level Hydra Pro support that clients have used up to this point, but overall Hydra Studio now has the proper real-estate it deserves on the support website.   </p>

<p><strong>Django Auth and PyCharm Integration</strong> - <a href="http://youtu.be/q4Pwk40Zpvw">Presentation</a></p>

<p>Vitaly worked on a Django auth back for the hydra service, available <a href="https://github.com/vbabiy/django-hydra-auth-backend">here</a>. It allows people to quickly build a site that ties user auth on the site to a hydra user account.</p>

<p><strong>Leaderboard Updates: Ranking</strong> - <a href="http://youtu.be/8GjZrkFY_sY">Presentation</a></p>

<p>David C. worked on two alternate styles of ranking for Hydra's leaderboard library. </p>

<p><strong>Storm</strong></p>

<p>Andrew spent his time becoming acquainted with Storm. He had hoped to do some real useful data processing, but instead spent the time familiarizing himself with the technologies involved. </p>

While in San Francisco, they had the opportunity to meet with a number of clients, partners, and industry professionals to talk about what is new and exciting at Agora. </p>

<p>We are happy to report that interest in the Hydra platform was once again very strong throughout our entire week at GDC.  The many connections and conversations that our team participated in during this year’s GDC conference will be showcased in a number of exciting titles planned for release in 2014 and 2015.</p>

<p>We want to take this opportunity to thank all of the individuals who met with the Agora Games team at GDC 2014.  Your support and feedback is greatly appreciated, and we look forward to another exciting year working with our development partners.</p>

<p>It has been a few months since our last Hydra Studio Features post. This is in part because the Hydra Studio Team has been hard at work developing a lot of new features, all of which are available to our users now! </p>

<p>Below is an overview of the new features that have been released. Please take a moment to review, and then head to the Hydra Studio dashboard and give everything a test run. Make sure to share your thoughts on the <a href="http://support.agoragames.com/">Beta Support Forum</a> as your feedback is extremely valuable.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="usernamepassword-auth"><strong>Username/Password Auth</strong></h4>

<p>One of our major enhancements was the expansion of our Authentication System. Made available late fall, Hydra Studio now supports a variety of authentication schemes to fit your game's needs. </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>UUID</strong> - Given a unique identifier, Hydra will map it to a game account</li>
  <li><strong>Facebook</strong> - Given a valid Facebook auth token, Hydra will map it to a game account</li>
  <li><strong>Anonymous</strong> - A one time, pass-through, scheme which will return a valid auth token for a new account every time it is used</li>
  <li><strong>Hydra</strong> -  A username/password account per the environment of your API key</li>
  <li><strong>Windows Live</strong> - Given a valid Windows Live auth token, Hydra will map it to a game account</li>
  <li><strong>Google</strong> - Given a valid Google auth token, Hydra will map it to a game account</li>
  <li><strong>Steam</strong> - Given a valid, hex encoded, encrypted app ticket for a user of your Steam game, Hydra will map it to a game account</li>
  <li><strong>Custom</strong> - Tells Hydra to use an existing authentication system. Given a token that is accepted by your custom authentication url, Hydra will map it to a game account. If a game account does not exist for this token, Hydra will crete a new game account and associate it with the account in your system. </li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, we now provide a way for user to recover an account in case they cannot access it by any other authentication method. However, this requires an email being set on their account. If there is no email set, their account cannot be recovered. </p>

<p>Technical notes may be found in the <a href="https://hydra.agoragames.com/documentation/authentication.html">Authentication Documentation page</a>. </p>

<hr />

<h4 id="realtime-networking"><strong>Realtime Networking</strong></h4>

<p>Early February, we deployed a number of important infrastructure improvements to Hydra Studio. These enhancements included an update to a new Realtime protocol. Our platform now provides the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Added support for UDP realtime connection - full reliable/unreliable support</li>
  <li>Added support for multiple realtime connections for the same account</li>
  <li>Realtime Connected and Disconnected events now pass the protocol of the underlying connection that was connected or disconnected</li>
</ul>

<p>More detailed information may be found in the <a href="https://hydra.agoragames.com/documentation/realtime.html">Realtime Networking Documentation page</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="rest-api"><strong>REST API</strong></h4>

<p>We recently added REST API documentation to our Hydra Studio <a href="https://hydra.agoragames.com/documentation/">Game Integration Docs</a>. The Guide provides a general overview of the Hydra REST API, a Getting Started section for those beginning the process, and a <a href="https://hydra.agoragames.com/documentation/rest/reference.html">REST Endpoint Reference</a>. </p>

<p>For an example of how Hydra REST API may be used, visit our <a href="http://hydra-rest-api-demo.herokuapp.com/">Demo site</a>. </p>

Check out the link of each project for the full presentation. </p>

<p><strong>REST API DOCUMENTATION &amp; DEMO</strong> - <a href="http://youtu.be/kBIYZc_tVEU">Presentation</a></p>

<p>Steve added public facing Rest API documentation for Hydra studio, including references for each available endpoint. </p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://hydra.agoragames.com/documentation/rest/overview.html">REST Integration Guide</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://hydra.agoragames.com/documentation/rest/reference.html">API Reference Guide</a></li>
</ul>

<p>He also worked on a sample website that is using our Rest API. The website interacts with our Accounts (sign in/registration), Profiles, Achievements, Broadcasts, Leaderboards and Friends features. </p>

<p><strong>ANALYTICS FRAMEWORK</strong> - <a href="http://youtu.be/2ejFGG_AfP0">Presentation</a></p>

<p>Aaron worked on a "real world" example of how to use the analytics framework he recently started.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/pluto/tree/example">Pluto Analytics Engine</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HYDRA STUDIO SERVER-SIDE CODE</strong> - <a href="http://youtu.be/KR1ba2zFxGk">Presentation</a></p>

<p>Brad worked on and demonstrated Hydra Studio's server-side code working with real code. </p>

<p><strong>SINGLE-PAGE BROWSER APP WITH HYDRA BACKEND</strong> - <a href="http://youtu.be/4tOKX50CMug">Presentation</a></p>

<p>Andrew experimented with a single-page browser app communicating with Hydra via XHR requests in Javascript. It was compiled from Clojurescript with DOM updates via the Reagent library built on the React library. </p>

<p><strong>REDIS LEADERBOARDS</strong> - <a href="http://youtu.be/B_asjeIp4d8">Presentation</a></p>

<p>David C. worked on extracting out various bits of logic from our leaderboard library that retrieves leader data and trying to create Lua functions in Redis from them. This would allow us to have a more complete transaction when retrieving leaderboard data from Redis.</p>

<p><strong>ZURB FOUNDATION 5</strong></p>

<p>Jack attempted to migrate Agora's front-end framework from ZURB Foundation version 4 to version 5. For now, he decided to put off merging it into master, since he ran into some obstacles with the JavaScript migration, and the new features of version 5 didn't include anything that he felt we urgently needed. For the time being, he considers it an exploratory project.</p>

<p><strong>OUYA GAME ANDROID DEMO</strong></p>

<p>David A. worked on porting a demo OUYA game to android, and added Hydra Studio Matchmaking and Realtime features. By the end of Agora's Hackathon, he was able to demonstrate a mobile to mobile realtime match.</p>

Internal open source refers to our public projects that you can find over at our <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/">Agora Games GitHub</a> account. External open source work refers to projects that we contribute to in off-hours and may or may not have anything to do with video games because we’re swell folks like that. Pretty simple right? Here goes…</p>

<p>We're playing a bit of catch up since migrating our blog.</p>

<p><strong>chai</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/chai">chai</a> provides a very easy to use api for mocking/stubbing your python objects, patterned after the <a href="http://mocha.rubyforge.org/">Mocha</a> library for Ruby. A couple of important issues have been addressed in the 0.4.6 and 0.4.7 releases. As of 0.4.6, immediately after running a test, we teardown the stubs. This fixes any problems with exception handling, such as UnexpectedCall, when methods involved in exception handling, such as <code>open</code>, have been stubbed. In 0.4.7, we addressed a regression in 0.4.6, so that <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/chai/pull/16">reporting on unmet expectations is correct</a>.</p>

<p><strong>confirm-with-reveal</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/confirm-with-reveal">confirm-with-reveal</a> is a replacement for window.confirm() using the Reveal modal popup plugin from Zurb Foundation. In the release we did on 2014-01-16, we made the <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/confirm-with-reveal/issues/2">jQuery plugin compatible with jQuery.noConflict();</a>.</p>

<p><strong>stache</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/stache">stache</a> is our Rails 3.x and Rails 4.x compatible Mustache/Handlebars Template Handler, with support for partials and a couple extra niceties to make sharing the raw templates with client-side javascript a little easier. As of stache 1.0.3, the library is now compatible with Rails 4.x and you can now <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/stache/pull/31">access RSpec-assigned instance variables in view classes</a>.</p>

<p><strong>torus</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/torus">torus</a> is a service implementing the Carbon protocol to store time series data using <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/kairos">kairos</a> and an HTTP server to query and analyze the data. As of the 0.6.2 release, we've added support for SQL and Cassandra databases in schemas, added a tool for migrating data betwen schemas, fixed a significant performance issue in all endpoints, improved the "Quick Start" documentation, as well addressing a number of smaller issues. The <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/torus/blob/master/CHANGELOG">CHANGELOG</a> goes into more detail on the 0.6.0 through 0.6.2 releases.</p>
