I mean, wikis are just git repos, right? I am equally interested in documentation changes as in software changes."</p> <p>It is possible to do this in a little bit of a roundabout way. Read on to see how I did this with <a href="//hudson-ci.org/">Hudson</a>, our Continuous Integration server.</p> <ul> <li> <p>We have the <a href="https://github.com/jlewallen/jenkins-hipchat-plugin">Jenkins HipChat plugin</a> installed and configured in Hudson.</p> </li> <li> <p>Grab the Wiki Git Access URL for your project, e.g. git@github.com:myorganization/my-project.wiki.git</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a new project in Hudson to monitor the project's Wiki Git repository. Relevant items to setup in the project would be as follows:</p> </li> </ul> <p>Project name: Identify in the project name that it is the Wiki for your project so as to not be confused with actual project software notifications.</p> <p>Source code management: Set to git and use the Wiki Git Access URL for your project here.</p> <p>Branches to build: **</p> <p>Poll SCM: I set to check every 30 minutes. Example:</p> <p>*/30 * * * *</p> <p>In the Post-build actions: check the box for HipChat notification and set the name of the room to the one where notifications on Wiki changes should be sent to.</p> <p>And you're done! If there are no changes to the wiki since the last poll, you won't get any notices from Hudson. If there are changes to the wiki since the last poll, a notification will be posted to HipChat. Folks can then click the link in Hudson to see the list of changes.</p> <p>You can find more hilarity over on my Twitter account, <a href="//twitter.com/czarneckid">@CzarneckiD</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jun 13 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/06/13/agorian-survival-new-employee-edition/">Agorian Survival: New employee edition</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>An Intern</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>Around this time last year, I was preparing to return to my internship with a fortune 50 company. However, the excitement that normally comes with such an accomplishment escaped me. The reason is because I knew exactly what to expect. I’d dress up in typical business attire and sit at my desk from 9-5, while waiting for the occasional computer crash or random fire drill. With so much to look forward to, who could complain, right?</p> <p>Wrong. When my last day came, I decided that I had officially retired the repetition, stress and boredom. After putting my best foot forward, I landed a job at Agora Games and things were completely different. I seemed to have entered an unfamiliar world, full of fun and exciting individuals with no limit to their creative potential. The plethora of randomness and the nature of our work, combined with the flexibility and surreal environment, formulated a culture that removed the work out of the job.</p> <p>On your first day at Agora, you will be set up at a new computer with a standard four-legged chair. I mention the chair’s regularity because it is then your prerogative to choose a new one from Staples. Your first course of action however, is to tour around the office for a company-wide meet and greet. Of course, no one expects that you’ll remember their name. Down the line, people will generally re-introduce themselves and try to get to know the family’s new addition.</p> <p>Like many, I place high value on self-expression. With that, I can proudly say that one of the biggest perks you’ll find at Agora is freedom.  This isn’t a bureaucratic work environment where you’ll get sanctioned for forgetting to tuck in your shirt.  Whether you want to dress like Prince or the old school New York Knicks players is up to you.</p> <p>Expect to find the necessary hierarchies and team divisions, which keep us organized and successful but you won’t be able to tell who’s who. Just yesterday a few of us went for ice cream with the CEO. We’re well structured which leads us to power projects like Guitar Hero, Call of Duty, or Mortal Kombat but at the same time, perfectly balanced to produce happier, more driven employees.</p> <p>To conclude this rant, I have a lot to look forward to and a lot to learn, but I also have an array of exciting individuals to learn from.  Additionally, with the constant stream of new challenges that keep me enticed, I couldn’t have chosen a better place to work.</p> <p> </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jun 9 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/06/09/the-friendly-point/">The Friendly Point</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Blake Taylor</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>Do you use points or do you use pixels? I've fallen in love with points. If you know me, you might already know this because I talk about them all the time. So what is it that I like about points, or perhaps, what is it that I dislike about pixels?</p> <p>First off, did you know that a pixel isn't actually a pixel? As it turns out, what we refer to as a pixel nowadays, is more accurately defined as a device independent pixel, also known as a kludge. Consider this, you’re a developer, 10 years back, listening to bootylicious while styling with your bowl haircut. You’re probably specifying things in pixels with the assumption that monitors will never have more than the cutting edge 96ppi. Now fast-forward to present day with our 400 some odd pixel iPhone displays and consider how compressed that same page looks. Displays may be increasing in resolution, but our eyes aren’t. Additionally, we can't let our pixel-based designs shrink as resolution increases, so we what do we do? We redefine the pixel to the critical measure of 1/96 of an inch.</p> <p>Interestingly enough, this measure does have magical properties of it's own. However, it’s a system that seems to be rooted in happenstance, so I feel a little dirty about using it without considering anything more. The point system, on the other hand, not only doesn't suffer from this shameful introduction, but hell, there's elegance in its history.</p> <p>The point (pt) goes way back and has a helpful cousin, the pica, with its own special abilities. So why do you think those crazy typesetters and print practitioners choose the point and the pica even to this day? I would certainly propose flexibility as the reason. 1 pixel is equivalent to 1/96 of an inch, what the hell does that mean? Now, consider 1/72 of an inch and we're getting into the territory where I might actually recognize the difference of a single unit. We're all familiar with 12pt font, there's also 11, 10, 9, and 8. It’s simple enough, pick a font above 7 and you’ll be able to read it. What about 32pt? That's headline font in the print world. Guess what, there's no reason why it can't be used in the web world as well. It's just that we realize we're moving bits around and not ink, so we use relative measures such as the em for fonts, but it should all still be rooted in the friendly point.</p> <p>So what's a pica? Well a pica is 1/6 of an inch. 6, huh, well that's a nice number. Half of that is 3. I like 3. Get this, if there's 6 pica in an inch and there's 72 points in an inch, then that means there's 12 points in pica. 12, now that's an awesome number. It's evenly divisible by 2, 3, and 4. How many numbers can you say that about? I'm sure the answer is infinite, but now you’re just being a jerk and you’re missing my point. 12 is cool, 6 is cool, 3 is cool, 1.5 is cool, .75 is cool even .375 is manageable. Let's go the other way. 24 = 2pc, 48 = 4pc, 96 = 8pc. There's that damn number again.</p> <p>Anyway, what's my point? (No pun intended) Use points. They're there and they're not fugly. Converting pixels into points is easy, just multiply by .75. Also, since it’s rooted in what's made print look good for years rather then what the state of the art was when CSS became popular, the numbers just tend to work out nicer. Give em a try (haha, another pun); what do you have to lose?</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jun 7 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/06/07/did-you-miss-mlg-columbus/">Did you miss MLG Columbus?</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Brian Corrigan</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>This weekend, MLG held a highly competitive, highly anticipated competition to test the strengths of pro gamers alike. The Pro Circuit, this time in Columbus, Ohio, included a number of competitors facing off for champion status in StarCraft 2, Halo: Reach and Call of Duty: Black Ops.  The three-day event concluded as follows:</p> <p><strong>StarCraft 2</strong></p> <p>SlayerSMMA, the “Terran” prodigy, defeated second place winner IMLosira in the finals with a four to one win. MMA didn’t lose a single series all weekend and only dropped two games in total. Entering game four with a two-to-one lead, MMA survived massive Roach/Baneling attacks and executed excellent drop plays to shut Losira down. In game five, MMA deployed early reapers to kill off Losira’s drones. He eventually followed up with a big Marine/Tank force to force the surrender.</p> <p><strong>Halo:</strong> Reach</p> <p>Dropping just one map, team Instinct, consisting of Ogre 2, Roy, Lunchbox and Pistola, were crowned MLG Columbus Halo champions. Instinct left with an amazing record of 21:1 after having defeated second place winner Str8 Rippin. It wasn’t until facing third place winners Dynasty in the WB final that they dropped a game. That however didn’t faze the team as they continued on to win the match and dominate the tournament.</p> <p><strong>Call of Duty:</strong> Black Ops</p> <p>MLG Columbus produced a surprising sequence of events during the Call of Duty match ups. As day three continued, some of the highly favored teams fell into the losers bracket and the finals ended in an unexpected sweep. Optic Gaming was the victor who claimed the Black Ops Pro Circuit trophy.  Force, who was originally twelfth seeded, earned second place after losing six to none.</p> <p>Overall, the event continues to open doors for young teams like Fly Society who placed ninth, but managed to make a name for themselves. Congratulations to all of the winners and shout out to everyone who helped make this possible. The next event is in July at Anaheim, CA; can you afford to miss greatness in the making? http:www.majorleaguegaming.com</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jun 6 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/06/06/cucumber-and-behavior-driven-infrastructure-validation/">Cucumber and Behavior Driven Infrastructure Validation</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>Did you ever think to use Cucumber to write scenarios to validate your infrastructure? Here's a short guide to help you get started.</p> <p>I'm going to keep this intentionally short because I don't want to steal the thunder away from our systems team, but I did get a fair number of pings inquiring about this after tweeting about it, so it's worth getting the word out.</p> <p><strong>Start a new infrastructure validation project</strong></p> <p>Your Gemfile should reference the gems for rake and cucumber at a minimum. The Rakefile can be the minimal Cucumber-ified to get started.</p> <p>{% gist 1011361 %}</p> <p><strong>Write your Cucumber features and scenarios for the parts of the infrastructure you want to validate</strong></p> <p>Examples of this may be "aliveness" of servers by pinging them or making sure processes are running. For example, with MySQL:</p> <p>{% gist 1011369 %}</p> <p>You'll need to back those scenario step definitions up with the appropriate code. I'm going to leave that out of this post for now.</p> <p><strong>Tag your scenarios appropriately</strong></p> <p>You should tag your scenarios in the manner that makes sense for your organization and in the way that you'll be running them and responding to them. For example, you may want to run @critical scenarios from cron every 5 minutes (or some appropriate interval) and make sure that if these fail, someone gets more than an e-mail. You may want to run @rise_and_shine scenarios at 6 AM after other system tasks have run, for example, to validate log rotation.</p> <p><strong>KISS me baby</strong></p> <p>Keep It Simple Stupid. If you just want to use this for sanity checks, that's cool. You might not need to go full scale <a href="//www.nagios.org/">Nagios</a> and <a href="//auxesis.github.com/cucumber-nagios/">cucumber-nagios</a> right away. Integrate this into your existing infrastructure and monitoring processes in the way that it makes the most sense.</p> <p>Hopefully this has been helpful to you.

Noire which caused me to want to research how to test multiple Ruby versions and gemsets using RVM, but that's besides the point. Here's how I went about it.</p> <p>I've been testing this with 2 gems I maintain, <a href="https://github.com/czarneckid/tasty">tasty</a> - a Ruby gem for interacting with the del.icio.us service and <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard">leaderboard</a> - Leaderboards backed by Redis in Ruby. I'll use tasty as the example for this blog post.</p> <p>The .rvmrc file for the tasty gem looks like:</p> <p>{% gist 996225 %}</p> <p>In the Rakefile for the tasty gem I have the following:</p> <p>{% gist 996230 %}</p> <p>If I run rake, I get the following output, correctly showing that rake uses the tasty_gem gemset for each version of Ruby.</p> <p>{% gist 996224 %}</p> <p>I also used "_gem" in the gemset names. Is that overkill?

Clarke Foley, Production Coordinator, and Devon Smith, QA Team Lead, represented Agora amongst a who's-who of Tech Valley companies. Nicholas Ruepp, Producer at Vicarious Visions (VV), spoke about how the successful game studio adapted to the Agile Development process during the production of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 in 2007.</p> <p>At this time, VV implemented 3-week sprints, burndown charts, and retrospectives, along with cork boards as a project-tracking tool. The "Big Wins" that were realized with the Scrum/Agile processes included seeing a steady level of effort from developers throughout a project life cycle, rather than the typical waterfall process and it's subsequent employee burnout.  Also, the new iterative planning allowed day-to-day developer overhead to be very low, and the entire company shifted its culture to a more cross-discipline mentality.</p> <p>Bill Hoffman, VP and CTO of Kitware Inc. began his presentation with a very poignant fact; “the use of Agile is intended to remove waste from the development system”. There are seven common inefficiencies that many game and software development companies face. These include partially done work, extra features, relearning, hand-offs, task switching, delays, and defects. Through Kitware's adaptation of the Agile process, they have been able to reduce inefficiencies in their workflow. Hoffman's token Agile ideology is the differing of feature commitment as long as possible. Doing this allows for flexibility while keeping options open as long as possible. According to Hoffman, having high-speed production must be enabled by inherent quality standards; the job of testing is to prevent defects not to find them.</p> <p>Hoffman mentioned that Kitware uses Mantis Issue Tracker, Visual Tool Kit, and Python scripts to create burndown charts. While the tools don't always make the mechanic, it is interesting to see which is preferred. At Agora, Pivotal Tracker and Lighthouse are the primary Agile Project Management tool and bug trackers. New testing tools for support of iterative software development include Cucumber, Rspec, and Litmus along with Siege for load testing. Overall, we look forward to the next Tech Valley event. We hope to hearing about other Capital Region technology firms and how they are increasing their production and profitability with the Agile Development process.</p> <p> </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> May 19 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/05/19/the-haigha-preview/">The Haigha Preview</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>Agora has released a preview of Haigha, its new Python client for Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). AMQP is a standardized application protocol for messaging middleware. Its purpose is to govern the behavior of the messaging provider and receiver to facilitate interoperability between vendors.</p> <p>Haigha is a descendant of py-amqplib, a common library used by the Python community. Haigha has been built from the ground up to use libevent for high performance IO while presenting a simple API that adheres to the form and function of the AMQP specification. It adds several useful features that simplify access to powerful AMQP idioms. By default, Haigha operates in a completely asynchronous mode, using callback-passing to trigger application code in response to AMQP events.</p> <p>For more information and installation, visit: <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/haigha"> https://github.com/agoragames/haigha</a></p> <p> </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Apr 29 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/04/29/speed-up-testing-with-spork/">Speed Up Testing With Spork</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>If you TATFT, embrace red-green-refactor, or you just want to speed up execution of your test suite, you might want to take a look at <a href="https://github.com/timcharper/spork">Spork</a>.
