That’s exactly how the six years old me would have described a Gameboy. Even with its primitive characteristics, the Gameboy is a feature in an evolutionary timeline that started many years before its arrival. If we go back to the beginning of human time, I’m sure that you’d be able to find some relative of gaming regardless of how basic. Competition and play are part of human nature, so whether it was punching wholes in the ground or killing the most mammoths, games can easily be made of anything.</p> <p>A game is defined as: an amusement, pastime or an activity, which requires skill and is usually some form of competition. Of course, by that definition not many things are subject to exclusion, but a search on Wikipedia or Google nowadays assumes a video game reference. Since man started tracking time, the earliest forms date back to 3000BC, one of which was a simple game of dice. Additionally, they were used then as they are today, as your common pastime for amusement or for competitive/ gambling purposes. Using the Romans as a prime example, they even had what became known as professional gamblers and eventually prohibition laws.</p> <p>Nowadays gaming has evolved into different categories. These include but are not limited to card games, board games, sports and the popular video games. Video games have also gone as far as merging all categories and changing the way they are experienced. Consider an ancient game like chess for example; it can now be played in a new environment without the physical board. Video games go as far back as the 1940s in early cathode ray tube-based missile defense systems. Originally designed for mainframe computers, videogames later expanded into consoles, personal computers and handhelds.</p> <p>Today, society has made it hard to fight a gaming addiction because they’re virtually everywhere. Most people have access to computers that undoubtedly hosts them, consoles have gotten cheaper, more affordable and best of all (depending on who you ask), they’ve invaded the mobile phone area. Some of the phone game graphics even rival popular handheld console systems. Hardware in systems is becoming more powerful and will continue to advance as time goes on. Today, we have consoles that offer 3d technology and some as far as virtual reality. I wonder what’s next, brain chips that let your mind be the console, maybe? Anyhow, for those of us that were old enough to enjoy them, I ask which was better, Gameboy, Atari or Game Gear. I personally vote for the Gameboy. Let me know in the comments below or on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/agoragames">twitter</a>.</p> <p> </p> <p><img width=150 height=150 src="/assets/images/uploads/2011/07/gameboy-150x150-b6ab7804.jpg"/></p> <p><img width=150 height=150 src="/assets/images/uploads/2011/07/gamegear-150x150-acb759ab.jpg"/></p> <p><img width=150 height=150 src="/assets/images/uploads/2011/07/lynx-150x150-e7c33075.jpg"/></p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jul 21 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/07/21/a-new-challenger-appears-videogames-art/">A New Challenger Appears! Videogames &lt;= Art? </a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Leslie Brezslin</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that there are some who hesitate when it comes to positively correlating video games and art.  Of course a statement like there is an art to playing (insert game) is invalid, but what about the finished product itself? This quote “Video games can never be art” by Roger Ebert has me stumped because games are simply hybrids of the art we take for granted everyday. For some, to appreciate a compilation,  one must examine each of the individual parts. To begin, what is art?</p> <p>Wikipedia describes art as “the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power”. Although this definition doesn’t go into specifics, there are many mediums through which art (specifically modern art) is experienced. Other than the two mentioned, some of the others include but aren’t limited to music, photography, literacy and motion pictures.</p> <p>My definition of an artist is a person who creates expressive works through available tools and mediums. Consider a composer, while Mason William&rsquo;s choice was the acoustic guitar, Jimmy Hendrix made a name for himself with the electric guitar.  The question is however, with the broad spectrum of tools that mankind has developed through the centuries, where do we draw the line between what’s art and what’s not?</p> <p>Painting, a classic art, liberates the trappings of the imagination by providing a platform for recreation and self-expression. Painting has gone from cave walls to the Mona Lisa over the years and below is an example by Johannes Vermeer called “the view of Delft”:</p> <p><img width=300 height=250 src="/assets/images/uploads/2011/07/Vermeer-view-of-delft-300x250-849fff04.jpg"/></p> <p>Now consider this work from one of the scenes in Brink:</p> <p><img width=300 height=136 src="/assets/images/uploads/2011/07/City-from-brink-300x136-7db70851.jpg"/></p> <p>This is an artist’s imagination of a world that doesn’t even exist. Regardless of the tools used to create it, the realism and openness to interpretation is at least similar to that of Vermeer. I regard re-creation and imagination as residing on two different planes of creativity. In my opinion, to paint something as it is in front of you isn’t as challenging as painting something as it could be. The interactivity of that world that games allow, tell a story but its brilliance isn’t limited to there. Lets take a motion picture. In this example, we’ll use a scene in a movie that derived from the book “Black Hawk Down” by <em>Mark Bowden.</em> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEGSQl9dDG0</p> <p>Compare this same scene to the popular video game Call of Duty:</p> <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-Kt83WmJec</p> <p>Will anyone  argue that films aren’t art? Black Hawk Down, won academy awards for its editing and sound; the aesthetics of the film. Undoubtedly, popping in a video you game will bring you very similar characteristics including performances. While Black Hawk Down is an expression of the battle of Mogadishu, COD is a portrayal of World War II. Although subjected to opinion, the only overlaying difference between the two, is the way they are experienced.</p> <p>They say when you wish to study emotion, you should consult an actor or musician, because it’s the true core of their professions. Music affects the mood and can be found in the background of most if not all films. It helps carry the scene and guide the audience as to how they should be feeling at any point in the plot. In the gaming world, before speech was a norm, music ruled all platforms and represented ninety percent of the sound that would be seen in games (the other ten percent representing the attempts at sound effects). Today, games have grown to feature both.  Some compositions have even grown to become so popular as to ignite re-creations or rearrangements (a feature that was only popular with historic classical pieces or pop music). Take for example the Kingdom Hearts theme song, Dearly Beloved: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g25QXnhVijQ Now compare that simplistic yet beautiful melody to this is composition by Kyle Landry: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ0E3dsHRV4</p> <p>Like the videos above, a quick search on Youtube bears many results of personalized variations; a growing arena. After all, what is art if not versatile enough to allow you to relate or re-express it as you see it?</p> <p>As stated by Kellee Santiago in her TED <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9y6MYDSAww">talk</a>, games are the cave paintings of what it can and probably will become. Although I agree that we&rsquo;ve only scratched the surface, I think that games aren’t the cave paintings but the evolution of the chicken scratch. It goes further than its predecessors in individualizing the experiences and allowing for a broader range of interpretations. Games are no longer just coded pixels, they&rsquo;re stories, paintings, and compositions. The code only allows them to mobilize and be experienced in a different way than the mediums before it. You can&rsquo;t mix all of the components of art together and disregard the hybrid as something different than its parent class. So are games works of art? yes! if you disagree, let me know in the comments below or on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/agoragames">twitter</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jul 20 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/07/20/soonatra-coming-soon-pages-on-sinatra/">Soonatra - 'Coming Soon' pages on Sinatra</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Logan Koester</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>I was recently tasked with creating a “coming soon” page for a new project. The requirements were the usual:</p> <ul> <li>Some description of the project features</li> <li>A form to signup for an email list / invites</li> <li>Display a few posts from an RSS feed</li> <li>Show some screenshots of what we’re building to collect early feedback</li> </ul> <p>We&rsquo;ve also been increasing our focus on A/B testing (aka &ldquo;split testing&rdquo;), so I wanted a way to try out different headlines and see which angle users find most interesting.</p> <p>This all sounds well and good, but it is very frustrating to take time away from the beginning of an exciting new project to invest in a page that will only be online for a few short weeks.</p> <p>I decided I don’t ever want to do it again, so I created  <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/soonatra">Soonatra</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/soonatra">Soonatra</a> is a simple  <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>-based framework for creating these pages quickly.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/soonatra">Soonatra</a> reduces the steps involved to: - Create a mailing list (we’re using  <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a>) - Choose some colors/graphics that fit well with your brand - Write the page copy and set an RSS feed url. - Deploy to a free  <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> account and park your domain.</p> <p>It is easy to extend and manage multiple themes thanks to  <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>, and does not require a database, instead using  <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> for RSS feed consumption and tracking A/B test results.</p> <p>You can fork the git repo and have your site up and running in minutes.</p> <p>See  <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/soonatra/blob/master/README.textile">README.textile</a> for all the juicy details.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jul 20 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/07/20/a-redis-cache-for-rss-consumption/">A Redis cache for RSS consumption</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Logan Koester</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>﻿If you’ve ever wanted to include some data from an RSS/Atom feed on a page from Ruby, you’ve probably run into this problem:</p> <blockquote> <p>It’s completely unreasonable to hammer the feed provider with a request every time the page is rendered, but it’s no more reasonable to use a big relational database like MySQL just to cache some stupid tweets or blog posts, especially if your application wouldn’t otherwise need one. But apparently this layer of persistance has been deemed out-of-scope by the creators of popular RSS consumer libraries such as  <a href="https://github.com/pauldix/feedzirra">Feedzirra</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>So I wrote a little gem called  <a href="https://github.com/logankoester/feedzirra-redis/">feedzirra-redis</a> to take care of this as transparently as possible. You can use it just like you would  <a href="https://github.com/pauldix/feedzirra">Feedzirra</a> normally, but your feeds and entries do not disappear at the end of the script, so you can do the dirty work from a Rakefile via cron instead of in the web request/response cycle while your users impatiently twiddle their thumbs.</p> <p><strong>Installation</strong></p> <p>$ gem install feedzirra-redis</p> <p> </p> <p>See the  <a href="https://github.com/logankoester/feedzirra-redis/blob/master/README.markdown">README</a> and  <a href="https://github.com/logankoester/feedzirra-redis/blob/master/test/test_feedzirra-redis.rb">test suite</a> for example usage.</p> <p>Enjoy!</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jul 8 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/07/08/1559/">June Recap</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>As June comes to an end, we remember that it brought more to us than the official start of summer. Below is a high level view of just a few of the projects and events that took place this month.</p> <p><strong>MLG Columbus</strong> Lets start off with our biggest event, MLG Columbus. This month’s Pro circuit was held during the weekend of June 3-5 in Columbus Ohio and obtained notable success. Throughout the weekend, nearly 15 thousand people showed up to support their favorite gamers. That however, was nothing near the 22.5 million people who streamed the event from their computers. With the major updates we made to our systems, we formulated the equation for a very successful pro circuit event that tromped the ones before it.</p> <p>﻿<strong>Git</strong></p> <p>This month we added a few new goodies to our Github portfolio accessible at github.com/agoragames. Some of which include:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/haigha"><strong>Haigha</strong></a></p> <p>Haigha provides a simple to use client library for interacting with AMQP brokers. It currently supports the 0.9.1 protocol and is integration tested against the latest RabbitMQ 2.4.1 (see <a href="http://dev.rabbitmq.com/wiki/Amqp091Errata">errata</a>). Haigha is a descendant of py-amqplib and owes much to its developers.</p> <p>The goals of haigha are performance, simplicity, and adherence to the form and function of the AMQP protocol. It adds a few useful features, such as the ChannelPool class and Channel.publish_synchronous, to ease use of powerful features in real-world applications.</p> <p>By default, Haigha operates in a completely asynchronous mode, relying on callbacks to notify application code of responses from the broker. Where applicable, nowait defaults to True. The application code is welcome to call a series of methods, and Haigha will manage the stack and synchronous handshakes in the event loop.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/gondola"><strong>Gondola</strong></a></p> <p>Gondola is a ruby gem which aims to bridge the gap between two very prominent, open source, quality assurance tools, Selenium IDE and Sauce Labs. Many quality assurance professionals who don&rsquo;t have the necessary technical skills to write Selenium webdriver-based unit tests prefer to do their web regression testing using solely the Selenium IDE and then exporting those test cases by some means to Sauce Labs&#39; system.</p> <p>Gondola offers an easier and more convenient system for dispatching tests written in Selenium IDE to a Sauce Labs account. Gondola transforms the html that Selenium IDE produces by default and ships it to Sauce Labs across a number of browsers in parallel. Test suites and projects can be easily organized with simple file directory structures.</p> <p>Beyond the console application that comes with the gem, Gondola offers a small API for integrating Gondola&rsquo;s features into custom web apps. This allows a user to bring Gondola&rsquo;s simplicity into an existing testing suite or a new web application. Specifically, we have a plan to write a sample Gondola web app to demonstrate its power.</p> <p>We’ve also added updates to the projects that were the deliverables of previous months. Check out the Git page for a full list.</p> <p><strong>Webby Awards</strong></p> <p>The Webby Award is the leading international award honoring excellence on the Internet. This year we won two webby awards, one for lifestyle and another for the other for games.</p> <p><strong>Mortal Kombat Fight Stick</strong></p> <p>This classic trophy is a gift from Warner Bros for the work that we did on the latest Mortal Kombat game. Currently, we are powering the stats on their website and are responsible for the creation of their in-game chat features.</p> <p><a href="http://tv.majorleaguegaming.com"><strong>MLG.tv</strong></a></p> <p>So MLG.tv has received numerous updates and features over the course of this month. One of those, is the user generated content feature with options such as SSO/login integration_, _video uploads, user channels and a user videos page. We’ve also added video rating and moderation capabilities along with several addition improvements on the back end of the site.</p> <p><strong>MLG Store</strong></p> <p>There have been quite a few updates deployed to the MLG store, making it simple and enjoyable to get the things you want. We’ve also heightened security in order to protect your information and prevent fraud while fostering a painless checkout process.</p> <p>These are just six of the things that went on during the sixth month of the year. Here at Agora we’re constantly working and implementing new back-end and front-end updates. Thank you to the team for a productive month and to you our followers for your support. For more detailed and on the spot update information, follow us on <a href="http://twitter.com/agoragames">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/agoragames">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.github.com/agoragames">Github</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jun 27 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/06/27/nerds-the-take-over/">Nerds: The Take Over</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Brian Corrigan</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>Several days ago, I was walking with my Agora Games t-shirt, which happens to bare the Major League Gaming (MLG) logo on the arm. Out of Dunkin Donuts, a young boy excitedly ran up to me. After catching his breath, he goes, “excuse me, do you compete in the MLG?” At that point I had gotten towed and was on the phone with the police so I simply shook my head no.</p> <p>Think back to high school; remember the assortment of social groups? To name a few, we had the jocks with expectations of college sports and the major leagues. Also, we had the dramatic arts students who hoped for the big break that would land them fame and fortune. There’s no forgetting the music students who dreamed of being rap or rock stars and finally, the nerds. Sadly there was no glamorous expectation for the nerds. They were expected to do your normal jobs, working for big companies or starting their own.</p> <p>Even when you considered the earning potential, there was still that essence of glory that was missing, unless you discovered something great. This however, started to change about eight years ago when Sundance started MLG. Today MLG is accurately described as a huge concert for gamers. The last event housed almost 15,000 while streaming to an audience of at least 22.5 million.</p> <p>After getting my car, I started thinking of the influence that MLG has on the new generation. To young kids, MLG is right up there with other professional leagues such as the NBA or the NFL. MLG already opens doors to huge opportunities for sponsorships and endorsement deals and will only go further. Additionally, as we attract more sponsors and fans, the growth potential becomes unlimited.</p> <p>Now consider the change that brings to that same high school scene. Finally, a means of recognition for those who lack the interest or ability to play sports, act out a scene or please a crowd with music. Now when you’re told to do something for your future, it’s arguable that you are investing in your future. So, to those siting on the couch pwning their friends in Halo, your path to glory awaits.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jun 24 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/06/24/of-penguins-rabbits-and-buses/">Of Penguins, Rabbits and Buses</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Aaron Westendorf</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>Here at Agora we make use of dedicated hardware and virtual machines running on our providers&#39; respective clouds. In recent months, we&rsquo;ve moved our RabbitMQ hosts onto hardware because we found that we could far exceed the CPU capacity of our virtual machines and it was far cheaper to run a small cluster of hardware hosts than a giant cluster of VMs. We used an existing, underutilized host for our primary traffic while awaiting delivery and installation of a new pair servers. Expecting a simple plug-and-play swap, I set out to test the new hardware before we made the transition. What follows is a harrowing tale into the deepest depths of modern hardware architecture.</p> <p>Our current primary RabbitMQ host, leviathan, is a 24 core Intel Xeon X5650 running at 2.67GHz and fitted with 132GB of RAM. The machine hosts all our in-memory databases, such as Redis and Memcached, and is vastly underutilized at this time. RabbitMQ is run in a cluster with other nodes hosted on VMs to give us failover capacity.</p> <p>To replace its role as RabbitMQ host, we purchased artemis and hermes, two 24 core AMD Opteron 6172s running at 2.1GHz and fitted with 8GB of RAM each. Recent versions of RabbitMQ page queue backlogs to disk, and our traffic pattern and infrastructure validations are such that this amount or RAM is sufficient.</p> <p>At first, one might assume that the differences in processors would result in near-equal <a href="http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/cpus/2010/03/31/amd-opteron-6174-vs-intel-xeon-x5650-review/1">performance</a> for RabbitMQ. The Intel CPUs have faster clock cycles, but they rely on Hyper-Threading to present 24 logical cores to the operating system. The AMD CPUs are slower, but they present 24 hardware cores to the kernel. <a href="http://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/5.2/Deployment_Guide/s2-proc-cpuinfo.html">Linux</a> reports 5333 bogomips for the Xeons, 4200 for the Opterons.</p> <p>Using <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/haigha">haigha</a>&rsquo;s load testing <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/haigha/blob/master/scripts/stress_test">script</a>, we were astonished to discover that our brand-new hardware was almost 50% slower than our until-recently-brand-new Intel hardware! What could possibly have gone wrong?</p> <p>The test that we ran consisted of 3 VM clients, each with 4 cores, each running 3 instances of the standard configuration of the <code>stress_test</code> script of 500 channels looping messages over 500 queues. That is, 4500 channels and queues, each channel publishing a message as soon as it receives its previously published message. The test would run for a fixed period of time, usually a minute.</p> <p>Our investigation started simple enough. Using top and our new favorite, htop, we observed that the kernel was using a substantial portion of each cores capacity. We also observed that cores were underutilized, as htop clearly showed a visible gap on the right-hand side the CPU graphs. Though not scientific, it appeared to be a 10-30% loss. A bit of <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/04/20/ubuntu_server_10_04/">research</a> implied that the Ubuntu 10.04.2 kernel, 2.6.32, was perhaps released around the same time as our AMD chips, and may not fully support them. We tested the latest patches to that release, 2.6.32-32, but did not observe any improvement.</p> <p>Venturing into unknown territory, we installed the latest kernel backported from maverick, 2.6.35-25. We immediately observed an improvement in CPU usage, such that all cores were near 100% utilization. Sadly though, our message throughput remained nearly the same, as user space consumed only 40% of each core. Yet when comparing a single instance of <code>stress_test</code> , leviathan and artemis performed nearly equal. In no case were we able to induce any IO wait, which was to be expected since we weren&rsquo;t hitting disk. Why would 24 cores of AMD be so dramatically different than 24 cores of Intel?</p> <p>With the obvious problems ruled out and the latest kernel installed, I started to dig deeper into the architectural differences between the two companies&#39; designs. Using <a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/natty/man1/lscpu.1.html">lscpu</a>, we can see two very different CPU designs.</p> <pre class="highlight plaintext"><code> leviathan:~$ lscpu

</code></pre> <p>The AMD CPUs have nearly double the amount of dedicated cache per core, but a much smaller (shared) L3 cache. Though this was clearly a fundamental difference, it did not seem adequate in explaining the vast amount of time that the kernel was consuming on each CPU. Yet the only reason why the kernel would be consuming so much time, without any IO wait, would be if it was waiting for something. What would Linux be waiting for that Intel was readily delivering?</p> <p>As I noted, our test was running 4500 unique channels and queues. In a <a href="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-discuss/2011-May/012991.html">reply</a> to a recent inquiry on the RabbitMQ mailing list, I learned that both channels and queues are allocated an Erlang process. A bit of searching and I found a useful <a href="http://www.erlang.org/euc/08/euc_smp.pdf">paper</a>[PDF] on the early SMP support in Erlang R12B, circa 2008. The diagrams show a single run queue from which all schedulers pull the next process to run.</p> <p>By R13B, each scheduler had a <a href="http://www.erlang.org/documentation/doc-5.7/doc/highlights.html">dedicated</a> run queue, vastly decreasing lock contention. Additionally, scheduling algorithms, and <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#system_flag-2">configuration thereof</a>, were designed specifically to take advantage of the variety of SMP architectures. RabbitMQ is running on R14B01, and so it should have the latest in SMP optimizations, particularly with respect to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Uniform_Memory_Access">NUMA</a>, which is how both Intel and AMD implement their SMP architectures.</p> <p>Linux is also NUMA-aware, and contains scheduling algorithms that try to pair the core that a process or thread will use with the NUMA node where its memory is allocated. Likewise, it tries to allocate memory on the same NUMA node as the process or thread that is requesting it. This was a topic area we were already familiar with, but in terms of <a href="http://jcole.us/blog/archives/2010/09/28/mysql-swap-insanity-and-the-numa-architecture/">database applications</a> that consume most of system RAM. That clearly was not the case here, as RabbitMQ barely consumed 500MB under the stress test, and the memory is allocated on demand, and so was spread evenly across all NUMA nodes.</p> <p>So with hardware that benchmarked well, using recent releases of the Linux kernel and Erlang VM, and an application that used a small fraction of available RAM, RabbitMQ performed abysmally slow. What could possibly cause such behavior?</p> <p>The final piece of the puzzle lay in the nature of RabbitMQ itself. Though Erlang may try to pair a process with a node-bound scheduler, and Linux allocate memory on the same node as that scheduler, that&rsquo;s of little use in practice. When a message is read from a connection (itself a process) on a channel (also a process), the route of that message must be looked up in an mnesia-backed global table to determine which queue(s) the message should be copied to. Bits are allocated and written to for that queue (yet another process), and then any consumer of that queue - a channel - must read the bits before sending them out. In short, there is a near-0 chance that the bits necessary to fulfill a single publish-route-consume will be processed by the same scheduler, and a just-slightly-greater-than-0 chance that it will be processed by a scheduler on the same NUMA node. Even if the code is optimized to only copy messages as references, numerous reads and writes must acquire an exclusive lock on a NUMA nodes memory bus.</p> <p>So what&rsquo;s the difference between Intel and AMD NUMA implementations?</p> <pre class="highlight plaintext"><code> leviathan:~$ numactl -H

</code></pre> <p>The AMD cores are split across four nodes, whereas the Intel cores only use two. In the case where a process uses all cores equally, there is a 50% probability of a memory operation being local on a Xeon processor, but only a 25% probability on an Opteron!</p> <p>Starting RabbitMQ on just 2 nodes, I instantly gained nearly 30% improvement, using half the available processing power, and kernel time dropped to a far more normal 20-30% per core. I experimented with this for a few hours, and found that 3 nodes, with memory interleave across all 4 nodes, was the optimal configuration. But what of the Erlang scheduler?</p> <pre class="highlight plaintext"><code> artemis:~$ erl

As it turns out though, all of the scheduler types that are documented as designed for NUMA were slower than the simple <code>processor_spread</code> scheduler, which out-performed the NUMA schedulers by almost 30%. And what of the number of schedulers and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1182025/what-do-the-erlang-emulator-info-statements-mean">request queues</a>? Though they&rsquo;re configured for 24 cores, experiments show that the default number of 24 is best, even given only 18 cores of execution. I can&rsquo;t speak to why exactly either of these two settings are best, but I can entertain any number of educated guesses.</p> <p>The last question that remained was, if we&rsquo;re to run with 3 out of 4 NUMA nodes, which ones do we choose? It seemed logical to pick the ones that weren&rsquo;t connected directly to the network card, the only other bit of hardware which we were trying to push as many bits through as possible.</p> <pre class="highlight plaintext"><code> artemis:~$ lspci -tv

Your installation will have these stanzas in various places depending on the distribution and how your administrator configured the runtime scripts. Note that we turned off <a href="http://www.erlang-solutions.com/thesis/tcp_optimisation/tcp_optimisation.html">async threads</a>.

</code></pre> <p>The final result? Using only 18 AMD cores of execution, artemis achieved 93% of the performance of leviathans 24 Intel cores. Given that Linux calculated a 22% performance difference, we&rsquo;ll call that a win. Who can complain about two hosts capable of 40,000 messages each vs. a single host capable of 43,000?</p> <p>What can we learn from this? Firstly, know the hardware you&rsquo;re buying. No matter how this played out, the Intel chips benchmarked faster, and we should have stuck with those when purchasing our RabbitMQ hosts. Second, the physical layout of the data path and the nature of your application together determine the bounds of your capacity. <em>Any</em> multithreaded application configured to use all of your cores, where the memory access pattern is not localized to a single thread, will exhibit <em>non-linear</em> performance inversely proportional to the number of NUMA nodes those threads run on.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jun 23 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/06/23/hero-or-villain/">Hero or Villain?</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Leslie Brezslin</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>When we play video games, we are automatically transported into a world that stretches beyond the line of current reality. Within this world, you are granted complete freedom while omitting consequences. Many people play games because it’s a channel through which we can live out the impossible. While there are many other reasons, I question whether our attention spans are the only things being is injected into the games we play.</p> <p>Today, many games offer the ability to play as either a good or evil character. For me, the evil character is usually more appealing. The reason is simply because I know it’s fake. I figure, hey; if you’re going to enter a fictional world, why enter as yourself? Why enter just to follow the laws and moral code of the current realm that you’re trying to escape?</p> <p>I was curious as to see what the general consensus on the matter was, so I asked around. The answer to the question wasn’t very surprising at all. It seems like the majority of people (at least here at the office) enter gaming worlds as heroes serving the laws of “good” and fighting for justice. Some people claimed to enjoy the feeling of cleaning up the crap in this world while others did it for the honor. Those who chose the villain were those who only cared about an entertaining storyline. I however, have my own theory on the matter.</p> <p>For many people, playing games does not eliminate the sense of morality and duty to the world’s wellbeing that we’ve been encoded to uphold. We perceive what goes on in games, as we perceive ourselves in those situations. Some of us even go as far as to subconsciously apply methods like Karma to those situations. Our moral codes enter the game along with our attention spans and we block ourselves from completely enjoying the total package.</p> <p>So, what’s the lesson to be learned? Next time you turn on a video game, escape yourself. Forget the world on your shoulders and do as you see fit. If the color of the houses annoys you, burn down the village. You have ample time to spend as a good person in the real world.</p> <p>Perfect Example right here &mdash;&gt; http://kotaku.com/5815150/saints-row-the-third-revels-in-the-absurd</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jun 22 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/06/22/secrets-to-success/">Secrets to success</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Mike DelPrete</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>Success pertains to anyone willing to grab it, however, the majority will experience it through different channels. A lot of people measure success by a person’s current status; what they have, who they know and ultimately where they are. Only, is this a correct scale upon which to measure a person’s triumphs? When measuring success, should you look at the point where a person has landed or consider the journey from where they made the initial jump?</p> <p>Personally, I prefer to look at the whole picture as opposed to one part of it. The fact of the matter is, although all men were created equal, not all were born with the same opportunities. Ultimately, we have the potential to reach the highest form of glory as well as the lowest. That’s why my measure of success is based on analyzing the whole path that a person has traveled. Someone starting at a lower position has a lot more work to put in, but can eventually reach the highest outcome.</p> <p>The world has many opportunities to offer and many are determined enough to recognize them. One example of this is Mike DelPrete, the CEO of Agora Games. Mike started Agora Games eight years ago and it thrived both before and after it’s acquisition by MLG. When I asked Mike what the secret to his success was, he told me to ”get back to work.” Idealistically, I took that for stay focused and continue with the task at hand. After surviving his ocean of emails, meetings and conferences, Mike specified “hard work, determination, and having an open mind.”</p> <p>The pillars of success reside on the platform of determination. Needless to say, that platform isn’t leveled. This is one of the leading causes of the gap between those who prosper and those who fall behind. The result that you can expect to gain from any experience is positively correlated to the sacrifices that you’re willing to make. Of course some dream bigger than others, but many fail to make it through the first stage: desire. Without a constant desire for something greater, can you expect progress?</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jun 21 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/06/21/introducing-haigha/">Introducing Haigha</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Aaron Westendorf</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>We&rsquo;re pleased to announce the official release of haigha, our Python AMQP client library.</p> <p>Haigha is the culmination of over 2 years of development. We&rsquo;ve used RabbitMQ since we launched our <a href="http://blog.agoragames.com/blog/2010/06/28/lifting-the-tail-inside-agora-skunk-works/">game services platform</a> and immediately fell in love with it and the power that AMQP afforded us. At the time that we began development, py-amqplib was the dominant client library. It fully-supported the 0.8.1 protocol features we made use of, but because it was blocking, fell short of our desire for an asynchronous, highly-scalable messaging layer on which to build our services. At the time, only <a href="https://launchpad.net/txamqp">txAMQP</a> supported asynchronous IO and we had ruled out Twisted for a variety of reasons. Pika, the official Python client maintained by RabbitMQ, had yet to be <a href="https://github.com/pika/pika/commit/d514dce7daf10cfc727cca9095ef0d114f9e4592">born</a>.</p> <p>With the py-amqplib source in hand, we deployed it directly into our stack and started heavily modifying it to integrate <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyevent/">pyevent</a>. By mid-2009 we had a stable and fast fork of py-amqplib and were able to scale our HTTP&lt;&gt;AMQP bridge to tens of thousands of concurrent connections. As these things are wont to go, once we had met our needs, and our schedules demanded focus on client deliverables, our fork languished, unknown to the world and quietly shuffling gigabytes of data across our network.</p> <p>Throughout 2010 we continually expressed a desire to release what we had done to the community at large, feeling that others could also benefit from a fast asynchronous AMQP client for their Python applications. Pika was maturing rapidly and interest was clearly growing for building the kind of applications that AMQP can support. We held out releasing anything, as the changes we had made to support event-driven IO had brought to light many problems in the layout of py-amqlib, and our fork was based on an older version of the code, before a major refactor. We felt that a ground-up re-write, with a clean and efficient architecture, was the right way to contribute back to the community and improve our own code base.</p> <p>In the dark pre-dawn hours of Friday 24 September 2010, haigha was <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/haigha/commit/2a4f63ddc08140f4078c396d32021256ad55762d">born</a> during the 2nd Agora Games hack-a-thon. By the <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/haigha/commit/36aad0cca6686d871fe0c8923eb460de743b2504">end</a> of the day we had a working demo with architectural details in place, and continued to develop features for the next few weeks before once again putting it on hold in favor of money-making enterprises.</p> <p>After a restful New Year vacation, we spent several weeks completing haigha, profiling and optimizing it, and integrating it into our game services stack. The transition was seamless, about the best anyone could ask given that a major component we rely upon was completely re-written and deployed against a major upgrade to RabbitMQ, as we transitioned from the 1.7 series to the 2.2 series and the 0.9.1 protocol.</p> <p>We still felt it poor form to release without comprehensive unit tests, and momentum was building to throw away <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pymox/">pymox</a> in favor of a new <a href="http://mocha.rubyforge.org/">Mocha</a>-inspired mocking library. In another pre-dawn fit of hack-a-thon inspiration, we launched <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/chai">Chai</a>. With the right tool for the job in hand, we set about completing our unit test suite.</p> <p>Once again, <a href="http://www.themortalkombat.com/">client deliverables</a> conspired to keep our code from finally seeing the light of day, but after the big crunch, we punched through a <a href="http://blog.agoragames.com/blog/2011/05/19/the-haigha-preview/">quietly-publicized</a> <a href="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-discuss/2011-May/012861.html">preview release</a>.</p> <p>After a few more weeks baking in the oven, we&rsquo;ve nearly completed code coverage, fixed many bugs, and generally cleaned house. We feel that haigha is now ready for the masses, and we&rsquo;re proud to put it out there for the rest of the community to use. We look forward to your <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/haigha/issues">feedback</a>.
