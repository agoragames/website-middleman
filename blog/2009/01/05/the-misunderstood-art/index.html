A video game by definition is a game played by electronically manipulating images produced by a computer program on a television screen or other display screen. By both definitions of each word, video games may be considered a form of art. The computer program which electronically manipulates images on a display screen must be created by a human. This human, must apply creative skill to create such images as well as the manipulation of images, images being a visual form. The definition of art clearly states that a the expression of human creativity is typically in a visual form, which video games by definition clearly do. Therefore, technically disregarding all personal opinions, culture, and other variable elements video games by definition are art. </p> <p>I strongly believe that video games are a form of art. Video games in fact include almost every single element of art there is. Let us analyze one of the most “accepted” forms of art in society which is included in video games, literature. Many video games these days staff writers to create a story for the particular game at hand. In fact, many game journalists include the quality of story within their review of a game. How much different is that then the <em>New York Times</em> reviewing a new novel? In fact, with games currently averaging about 20+ hours of gameplay it is safe to say that a well developed short story, or even a novel may be included within a video game. </p> <p>While one might argue that the quality of story is rather poor does this not also hold true to several novels? Sure one might say <em>Gears of War</em> had very poor dialogue and a rather poor story progression however, other titles provide players with a very well developed story and dialogue. An example of such a game in my opinion would be <em>Mass Effect,</em> in which a character Lorik Qui’in after you the player say, “I will let you go.” states the following, “Let me go? Do humans consider conversation a form of imprisonment? That would explain why so few of you are willing to sit down and talk…” This dialogue being directed at my character, therefore an extension of myself since I am controlling the character. The communication is not passive in nature, it is directed at myself and therefore directly impacts my thoughts and feelings on a personal level since it is I who am controlling this character, I who am a living breathing human being. The character being addressed is not print on a paper, it is my character, my choices which insinuated this response from Lorik. </p> <p>This method of immersion can not be achieved through a novel. Koster, touches on this subject by saying, “…games are very fundamental and powerful learning tools. It’s one thing to read in a book that “the map is not the territory” and another to have your armies rolled over by your opponent in a game. When the latter happens, you’re <em>gonna get the point</em> even if the actual armies aren’t marching into your suburban home.” Furthermore, video games are an accessible medium to any given audience. That is to say, while a certain skill is required to play a video game, both a novice gamer and an experience gamer will both be able to direct their in game experience into the subconscious, intuitive mind. However, in the art of literature, an experienced reader will gain a better experience into their subconscious, intuitive mind rather than a novice reader. </p> <p>Koster, in fact hits on this topic by comparing literature to games. “Consider the key differences between something like a book and different kinds of games. A book can do the logical conscious part of the brain pretty well. And really good readers have an ability to slurp that info directly into the subconscious, intuitive mind. But what a book will never be able to do is accelerate the grokking process to the degree that games do, because you cannot practice a pattern and run permutations on it with a book.” In essence, within a book you do not have the option to experience a scenario or event which you caused and observe the various outcomes of your actions. </p> <p>In addition to providing players with an immersive experience through literature, video games also provide creative visual elements which allow players to continue their immersion in a video game. Furthermore, combining both visual and literary elements provide the player with a unique experience which can not be simulated by any other form of art. Artists, art directors, and creative directors work in unison to give players a certain “feeling” or evoke a certain “emotion” while playing the game. </p> <p>The complexity and infancy of video games make the legitimacy of video games as a medium of art rather difficult to swallow. However, many other forms of art when first introduced went through the same life cycle. From the 1900s to the 1940s on screen films went from short black and white movies to full length hour long movies fully dressed with color and sound. As video games begin to mature and designers, programmers, artists, and musicians begin to become more experienced within this form of art I can only hope that the social stigma and media literacy problem evolves as well. One day I truly believe we will be walking through a museum watching interactive displays featuring some of the greatest forms of art, video games. </p> </div> </div> <div class='columns large-3'> <div class=blog-archives-sidebar> <h2>Blog archives</h2> <h3> <a href="/blog/2015/">2015</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2015/03/">March 2015</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2015/01/">January 2015</a> </li> </ul> <h3> <a href="/blog/2014/">2014</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/12/">December 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/11/">November 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/10/">October 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/08/">August 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/07/">July 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/06/">June 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/04/">April 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/03/">March 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/02/">February 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/01/">January 2014</a> </li> </ul> <h3> <a href="/blog/2013/">2013</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/11/">November 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/10/">October 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/09/">September 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/08/">August 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/07/">July 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/06/">June 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/05/">May 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/04/">April 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/03/">March 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/02/">February 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/01/">January 2013</a> </li> </ul> <h3> <a href="/blog/2012/">2012</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/12/">December 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/11/">November 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/10/">October 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/09/">September 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/08/">August 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/07/">July 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/06/">June 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/05/">May 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/04/">April 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/03/">March 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/02/">February 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/01/">January 2012</a> </li> </ul> <h3> <a href="/blog/2011/">2011</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/10/">October 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/09/">September 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/08/">August 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/07/">July 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/06/">June 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/05/">May 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/04/">April 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/03/">March 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/02/">February 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/01/">January 2011</a> </li> </ul> <h3> <a href="/blog/2010/">2010</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/12/">December 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/11/">November 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/10/">October 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/09/">September 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/08/">August 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/07/">July 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/06/">June 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/05/">May 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/04/">April 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/03/">March 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/02/">February 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/01/">January 2010</a> </li> </ul> <h3> <a href="/blog/2009/">2009</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/12/">December 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/11/">November 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/10/">October 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/09/">September 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/08/">August 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/07/">July 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/06/">June 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/05/">May 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/04/">April 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/03/">March 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/02/">February 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/01/">January 2009</a> </li> </ul> <h3> <a href="/blog/2008/">2008</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2008/11/">November 2008</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2008/10/">October 2008</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2008/09/">September 2008</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2008/08/">August 2008</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> <script src="/assets/javascripts/app-65d7c99d.js" async=true></script> </body> </html>
