Internet issues within our region slowed progress throughout the day, but the team managed to deliver some great projects.</p>

<p>We are attempting to better document Hack-a-thon projects with audio and video. The following showcase is our first endeavor. Video quality is not wonderful, but the audio is worth a listen. We will have our technical kinks worked out by Hack-a-thon 13.</p>

<p><strong>Torus Dashboard</strong></p>

<p>Andrew, Aaron, and Vitaly built a dashboard to graph data in Torus. Additionally, Aaron released version 0.8.0 of kairos with support for Cassandra, available <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/kairos">here</a>, and wrote a lot of new documentation. He then integrated that with torus.</p>

<p><strong>Hydra Studio Tutorial</strong></p>

<p>Steve built our first Hydra Studio async tutorial, available <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/AgoraGames/Hydra+Async+Tutorial/hydra_async_tutorial_WEB.html">here</a>. This tutorial will assist in guiding users through the process of building their very first asynchronous multiplayer game.</p>

<p><strong>FP Maze</strong></p>

<p>David Czarnecki began work on "The Maze Game". It procedurally generates mazes of varying difficulty and you win by making your way to the maze's exit.</p>

<p><strong>Automate SDK Release</strong></p>

<p>David Andrade wrote a simple gradle script to automatically package and release any of the Hydra SDK's. It will generate the appropriate archives, update the CHANGELOGs, and upload any files to our site.</p>

<p><strong>leaderboard</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard/">leaderboard</a> allows you to build leaderboards using Redis. The leaderboard (Ruby), <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-python">leaderboard-python</a> and <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-coffeescript">leaderboard-coffeescript</a> libraries all saw updates this week. In leaderboard 3.4.0, we added a method to be able to calculate the score for a given percentile value in the leaderboard. This same functionality was ported to leaderboard-python 2.6.0 and leaderboard-coffeescript 1.4.0.</p>

<p>In order to raise funds, attendees were encouraged to purchase an XP card and gain achievements by completing a task determined by exhibitors. Achievements could then be redeemed for reduced rates on snacks and games.</p>

<p>Agora featured two of our most recent Hydra Pro integrated releases, Injustice: Gods Among Us and Saints Row IV. We offered two opportunities for achievements: complete one match of Injustice and search for a character on the Saints Row community webpage. Character searches included Mark Twain, Minion, Nicolas Cage, Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, and Mario, among others.</p>

<p><strong>kairos</strong></p>

<p>Kairos provides time series storage using Redis, Mongo or SQL backends. Kairos is intended to replace RRD and Whisper in situations where the scale and flexibility of other data stores is required. Add Cassandra support to the list of backends supported with the 0.8.0 release. We also added limits when querying properties of a SQL stat, changed behavior of sets to include storage of all datapoints, positive or negative and added a table name option to SQL stores.</p>

<p>Steven Flenory, Studio Director at Agora Games, was recently invited to speak at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Steve provided the group of mostly freshman with an overview of the company, Agora’s beginnings and how we got where we are today. By speaking to such groups, Agora hopes to provide firsthand knowledge of the technology and gaming industry, while inspiring young, budding developers and entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>Agora Games was founded in 2005, born from the Incubation Program at RPI. The nation’s first such program, wholly sponsored and operated by a university, is open to all start-up enterprises with a technology-based product or service.</p>

The 0.7.0 release started adding in support for "discovery" endpoints for time series data as well as iteration handling and SQL data expiration support. As the backend support and test coverage increases, we've also provided a means to <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/kairos#id34">target the execution of the test suite with environment variables</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UberStrike.com – Community Global Leaderboard</strong></p>

<p>Hydra Studio's user based Leaderboard service is now powering UberStrike's global leaderboard on their community website. This service enhances player connectivity by providing users with rankings based off of any stat a game is tracking on profiles. Additionally, Leaderboards increase a game's replay value by constantly challenging players to improve their skill.</p>

<p><a href="http://s6.photobucket.com/user/stdreame/media/2827ad6a-e72b-45c7-a601-79726352c6ea.jpg.html"> <img alt=" photo 2827ad6a-e72b-45c7-a601-79726352c6ea.jpg" src="http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y221/stdreame/2827ad6a-e72b-45c7-a601-79726352c6ea.jpg" /> </a></p>

<p><strong>Hydra Studio Dashboard – Leaderboard Updates</strong></p>

<p>UberStrike currently provides a global leaderboard to players, but the CMUNE team has plans to implement in-game leaderboards and to expand their leaderboard offerings to include daily, weekly, and monthly rankings.</p>

<p><strong>Analytics</strong></p>

<p>Hydra Studio is automatically tracking the 17 million users playing UberStrike, individual player profile data, and other fundamental project statistics (total profiles, active users, and profile activity). This essential information not only provides developers with a quick snapshot of player engagement and retention, but drives game advancements by powering additional Hydra Studio services such as leaderboards.

<p>And we are back. Since our last announcement, the Hydra Studio team has rolled out a number of new features and enhancements. We still anticipate the launch of the Hydra Studio closed beta to the public later this year. Expect an official release date this Fall.</p>

<p>Below is an overview of the new features we released during the summer. Please take a moment to review, and then head to the Hydra Studio dashboard and give everything a test run. Make sure to share your thoughts on the <a href="http://support.agoragames.com/discussions/hydra-mobile-closed-beta-general-discussion">Beta Support Forum</a> as your feedback is extremely valuable.
## Matchmaking</p>

<p><a href="http://s6.photobucket.com/user/stdreame/media/84082bfa-d10d-4c21-874c-18224a27b416.jpg.html"> <img alt=" photo 84082bfa-d10d-4c21-874c-18224a27b416.jpg" src="http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y221/stdreame/84082bfa-d10d-4c21-874c-18224a27b416.jpg" /> </a></p>

<p>Brand new to Hydra Studio, we released our matchmaking feature early this summer. Our team recognized that there are multiple ways to connect players into a match. We now support matchmaking for all types of games based on user’s needs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fluid, or Quick-Matches</strong> - This Call of Duty style of matchmaking automatically creates a match and queries for other players who have defined the same set of criteria for a match type. If a match is unavailable, a new match is created. This style allows a match to exist while a search for other players continues and allows players to come and go.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fixed, or Criteria-Based Matches</strong> - This League of Legends style of matchmaking is suitable for match types that are session-based, or have a definitive beginning and end. This style promotes better matches by analyzing all current match requests and finding the best grouping of players.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For further details, visit our Matchmaking overview <a href="https://hydra.agoragames.com/documentation/matchmaking.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="match-enhancements">Match Enhancements</h2>

<p><a href="http://s6.photobucket.com/user/stdreame/media/abcea5b1-bd6f-4954-9535-f077585eda0a.jpg.html"> <img alt=" photo abcea5b1-bd6f-4954-9535-f077585eda0a.jpg" src="http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y221/stdreame/abcea5b1-bd6f-4954-9535-f077585eda0a.jpg" /> </a></p>

<p>Hydra Studio’s match service has expanded and now provides the infrastructure needed to support various match options including:
- The ability to create a match, join a match or join a ranked match as a group
- An optional parameter to request a reserved spot for invites
- Matches and profiles can now request which fields are returned when updated/fetching, enhancing performance</p>

<h2 id="friends-services">Friends Services</h2>
<p>You can now promote deeper levels of engagement by providing enhanced visibility within a player’s social circle. Combine existing friend features with our new friend interaction features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Notifications for successful friend additions</li>
  <li>The ability to get the online status of friends</li>
  <li>The ability to get presence notifications for friends (a change in online/offline)</li>
  <li>The ability to track and display mutual friends for a user</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, security and privacy enhancements may be used to provide players with the ability to block individual users, or set a global block to make an entire profile private.</p>

<h2 id="c-sdk">C++ SDK</h2>
<p>Now available for download, the Hydra Studio team has added our first iteration of a low-level SDK for maximum cross-device compatibility. We leveraged this early C++ SDK after a number of beta users requested Windows Support. Check out our demo app, publicly available <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/marble-maze-hydra-sample/630bf4d6-4bf0-4af9-a8d3-e9342c4c93c3">here</a>.
## Everything Else
In addition to the top level features above, we released a number of smaller updates during the summer months:</p>

<p><strong>1. Realtime Multiplayer</strong> - Improving on our Realtime Networking, we have added the ability to store temporary data about match state and time/latency of server session.</p>

<p><strong>2. Log Viewer</strong> - Errors generated during Dashboard use are now viewable and automatically saved with available JSON.</p>

<p><strong>3. Improvements to Analytics/Stats Display</strong> - Snapshot statistics, such as total profile count, have been added to our Statistics Display. We will continue to add to our available analytics over time.</p>

<p><strong>4. Added Stability Index</strong> - Stability for each feature is now displayed above their respective overview. View the Stability Index <a href="https://hydra.agoragames.com/documentation/index.html#">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>5. Improved Documentation Home Page and Added Documentation Search Feature</strong></p>

<h2 id="still-to-come">Still To Come</h2>

<p>Here is a list of the features that are currently under development, and that you'll be able to get your hands on soon:</p>

<p><strong>Friends</strong> - Facebook friend import</p>

<p><strong>Basic Username &amp; Password Auth Support</strong> - Will provide developers the opportunity to create and authorize profiles within Hydra studio using a standard username and password format.</p>

<p><strong>Continued Platform Load Testing and Infrastructure Enhancements</strong> - Will strengthen the performance of our entire feature set and global deploy support.</p>

<p><strong>Continued Research into Additional Engine Support</strong> - We’ll look to continue expanding the amount of engines Hydra Studio can work with. We’re already looking at Marmalade and other engines suggested by beta users, so keep your feedback coming!</p>

<p>Feel free to post questions on any of these features in our <a href="http://support.agoragames.com/discussions/hydra-mobile-closed-beta-general-discussion">Beta Support Forum</a>, and continue to put our platform to the test. Thanks a ton!

<p>We just had another amazing hack-a-thon here at Agora Games. For those of you who still don't know, every 2 months we put on a hack-a-thon event where, for 24 hours, all employees at Agora can work on whatever they want. It has to be tangentially related to what we do here at Agora, and you must have something completed by the end of the 24 hours. It's been a great tradition here at Agora, and is one we're looking to continue on for a long time!</p>

<p>Here a few of the projects from this hack-a-thon:</p>

<p>* <strong>Jack Letourneau</strong> - Worked on a web UI for creating compound Boolean queries up to one level deep in the drag-and-drop style of iOS's icon folders (drop one term onto another to create a new group).</p>

<p>* <strong>Brad Lafountain</strong> - Got our C++ SDK working with the Android NDK. Also worked on one of our Hydra demos (Verbs with Friends).</p>

<p>* <strong>David Andrade</strong> - Added several of our SDKs to a continuous integration server</p>

<p>* <strong>Steven Flenory</strong> - Submitted our beta Unity SDK to the Asset Store. Prepared community posts for open sign up</p>

<p>I love seeing how each of the projects vary across the individuals on the team! We'll be at it again in 2 months. Let us know if you have any cool ideas for us to work on!</p>

We also added a number of useful aliases for operations like grabbing, trimming and expiring feeds.</p>

A "collapse" parameter was added to "/series" which supports collapsing all of the data in the date range into a single result. This supports easy computation of aggregates across a time range, such as "maximum value in the last 7 days". Schemas can include "TRANSFORMS" stanza for defining a named map of data transforms that will be used when querying torus. hiredis is now a requirement as redis is not performant enough without it.

Transforms are performed after the collapse, allowing easy calculation of aggregates across an entire timeseries. We also added support in <code>get()</code> and <code>series()</code> for joining multiple timeseries into a single result by calling with a list of timeseries names rather than a single string. And finally we fixed an inconsistency in gauge type when collapsing or condensing gauge data. Value for an interval is the last recorded non-null gauge value now.</p>

The pull requests are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-python/issues/4">StrictRedis not considered when passing connection argument to Leaderboard</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-python/pull/5">don't deepcopy options</a> (branch: performance)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-python/pull/6">ASC sorted page_for was broken due to a spelling error</a> (branch: page_for-fix)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-python/pull/7">leaders() should return an empty list in case of an empty result set.</a> (branch: leaders-return-type)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-python/pull/8">remove unused calculation in leaders_in method.</a> (branch: unused-calculation)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-python/pull/9">proposal: consider using named key word arguments instead of **options</a> (branch: options)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-python/pull/10">add members_only option.</a> (branch: members_only-option)</li>
</ol>

<p>Aside from the first issue, which is a very clear and concise explanation of where an underlying and undocumented check in the library could trip up potential users of the library, all of the pull requests follow the same pattern:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Meaningful title</li>
  <li>Separate branch with a meaningful branch name per pull request</li>
  <li>Small, focused and tested pull request that could be evaluated independently</li>
  <li>Clearly identify a proposal pull request before embarking on code changes that may go against the convention or direction of the project</li>
</ul>

<p>How does all of this help me as a library maintainer? Well, meaningful titles in a pull request or issue help me to mentally narrow down the extent of the change(s) or the code I might be looking at without having to actually look at the code. To quote George Costanza from Seinfeld, "I like stuff you don't have to think about too much." Meaningful titles go a long way to making that happen. Separate branches are nice because I can evaluate the change(s) in the code independently of other feature changes. It also indicates that the contributor took the time to actually read the "contributing to this project" section in the README. None of the pull requests were more than a few lines of code and the ones that added or changed functionality included tests. That always helps since I'm more likely to integrate a pull request immediately if I can pull the feature branch, run the tests and know that the library won't break in strange and unusual ways. And finally, it's nice to propose larger feature changes that may affect the entire library in a small spike and to gauge interest from the library maintainer(s). It saves everyone a lot of time if it's functionality that isn't desired given conventions or direction of the project.</p>

<p>April was another busy month for the Hydra team and the Hydra closed beta. We accomplished another set of significant milestones that moves us even closer to launching the Hydra closed beta to the public later this year.</p>

<p>Below is an overview of the new features we released during April and the first week of May. Take a quick read, and then head to the Hydra dashboard and give everything a test run. Make sure you let us know your thoughts on the <a href="http://support.agoragames.com/discussions/hydra-mobile-closed-beta-general-discussion">Beta Support Forum</a> as your feedback is extremely valuable.
## User Account Enhancements</p>

<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/22229/e6tg6nsptproj53/user%20account%20enhancements.png"> <img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/22229/e6tg6nsptproj53/user%20account%20enhancements.png" /> </a></p>

<p>One of our largest enhancements this month was specific to our user account system. We officially moved from a purely global user account system to an environment specific user account system with our maintenance on May 8th. We made these changes based on beta user feedback, alongside a list of user account enhancements that we felt necessary to deploy after having the Hydra closed beta running for a few months now.</p>

<p>We expect to have development teams of all kinds using Hydra, and we feel its more important to provide developer tools to easily control the user accounts created by their titles, instead of having a purely global Hydra account system that requires all developers to fall in line with one specific setup. These changes help us achieve that.</p>

<p>To read a full overview of the changes and to better understand our thought process, please read our official <a href="http://support.agoragames.com/discussions/hydra-mobile-announcements-forum/36-58-hydra-beta-global-account-changes-1000am-et-please-read"> announcement post</a>.
## Dashboard Analytics</p>

<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/22229/myhmvdvtdzn372b/dashboard%20analytics.png"> <img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/22229/myhmvdvtdzn372b/dashboard%20analytics.png" /> </a></p>

<p>The 1st iteration of project analytics was released to the Hydra closed beta dashboard in April. The goal of our 1st iteration was to provide tracking of the most essential project statistics (active users, profile activity, match activity, and other basic feature activity). While these features are still running through basic QA currently, we have laid the foundation and you can begin working with these analytics now.</p>

<p>We have enabled a basic view of per-project-environment analytics that you can access via the "Statistics" link when working within any of your project environments. Additionally, from the statistics page you can select specific stats that you want visible on your environment dashboard (allowing for quick and easy viewing of those stats you view most important for your project).</p>

<p>Active user stats play a significant role in our Hydra pricing plans. On your main Hydra dashboard page we've also added active user stats so you can easily view the current usage numbers for all of your projects.</p>

<p>We have a lot more to add to our analytics offering, so please make sure you let us know your thoughts on what's most important to you!
## Data Export</p>

<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/22229/wv0jot5rkfdo86q/exports.png"> <img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/22229/wv0jot5rkfdo86q/exports.png" /> </a></p>

<p>Early in April we released data export functionality to the Hydra closed beta dashboard. You can now export all of your Hydra data to an Amazon S3 account. All you need to do is provide your AWS access key and a secret key (that allows Hydra to create and populate new Buckets) and we take care of the rest. You can create an export once every 24 hours, and you can see the status of your most recent export right on the Hydra closed beta dashboard.
## Everything else
In addition to the top level features above, we released a number of additional updates that we've detailed below:</p>

<p><strong>1. Facebook User Account Login</strong> - The hard work here is done, as we have fully integrated our user account system with the available Facebook API. We haven't officially released it to our beta users yet as we are closing up QA and SDK updates right now. We'll be working to make this functionality available as soon as we can.</p>

<p><strong>2. Automatic Leaderboard &amp; Achievement rebuilds</strong> - Easily add in new leaderboards and achievements as far after your project launch as you want. When you create a new leaderboard or achievement after your project has launched (and you already have a number of users with existing profile stats), Hydra will automatically rebuild and populate those leaderboards and achievements with existing user profile data for you.</p>

<p><strong>3. Pricing/Payment Processing</strong> - We've completed the 1st iteration of our payment processing functionality which directly ties into our <a href="https://hydra.agoragames.com/pricing">Hydra pricing plans</a>. We're using <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> for payment processing integration, and when we launch the Hydra beta to the public later this year you'll be able to manage your per-project pricing plans right on the dashboard. It's our goal to keep payment processing as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>

<p><strong>4. Improved "Getting Started" Guide</strong> - We've greatly improved the basic user workflow for all new beta users signing onto the Hydra dashboard for the first time. When new users sign on they'll quickly create their first project, and then walk-through the most essential steps to get Hydra up and running (with the dashboard providing information and tips along the way).
## Still to come
Here is a list of the features that are currently under development, and that you'll be able to get your hands on soon:</p>

<p><strong>Hydra C++ SDK</strong></p>

<p><strong>Environment cloning functionality</strong></p>

<p>**Friends - **Facebook friend import</p>

<p>**Chat/Presence - **First iteration of match/lobby chat functionality</p>

<p>Feel free to post questions on any of these features in our <a href="http://support.agoragames.com/discussions/hydra-mobile-closed-beta-general-discussion">Beta Support Forum</a>, and continue to put our platform to the test. Thanks a ton!

<p>The Hydra Team has been very busy during the month of March, and we've already released a number of features we have planned for our upcoming milestone (currently targeted for completion in May 2013).</p>

<p>Below is an overview of the new features we released this month. Take a quick read, and then head to the Hydra dashboard and give everything a test run. Make sure you let us know your thoughts on the <a href="http://support.agoragames.com/discussions/hydra-mobile-closed-beta-general-discussion">Beta Support Forum</a> as your feedback is extremely valuable.</p>

<h2 id="time-based-leaderboards">Time-based Leaderboards</h2>

<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/22229/i4od66jk26q5a5i/timebasedlbs.png"> <img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/22229/i4od66jk26q5a5i/timebasedlbs.png" /> </a></p>

<p>You can now easily create leaderboards that automatically expire and reset based on the time criteria you designate (daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly). Combine this new functionality with the global leaderboard support we already have in place, and you have a very solid leaderboard offering to make available to your users. Read our updated leaderboard documentation <a href="https://hydra.agoragames.com/documentation/leaderboards.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="match-configuration-enhancements">Match Configuration Enhancements</h2>

<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/22229/dg8n7nmt0i55a5p/match%20templates.png"> <img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/22229/dg8n7nmt0i55a5p/match%20templates.png" /> </a></p>

<p>The 1st iteration of the Hydra match template system allows you to easily create reusable match configurations. Those match configurations can then be used in matchmaking, ranked matches, and other Hydra services. Early match template documentation is available <a href="https://hydra.agoragames.com/documentation/match_templates.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="data-viewer-enhancements">Data Viewer Enhancements</h2>

<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/22229/tz06dypg7skhtr5/dashboard%20updates.png"> <img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/22229/tz06dypg7skhtr5/dashboard%20updates.png" /> </a></p>

<p>We've improved the Hydra dashboard data viewer in a number of ways that will make your development and QA easier. You can now view profile, achievement, and match data for individual users right in the Hydra dashboard. Access the profile data page of the Hydra dashboard, type in a user's profile name, and click search. We've organized this data so it's easy to access, and easy on the eyes.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can now view all of the leaderboard data coming from your game right in the Hydra dashboard. Access the leaderboards page of the Hydra dashboard, and then click the "Show" button next to the leaderboard you want to view.</p>

<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>

<p>In addition to the top level features above, we released a number of smaller updates during the month of March:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Leaderboards based on match stats</strong> - Users can now generate leaderboards and achievements based on match values (win, loss, rank)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Realtime Server Enhancements</strong> - We've shrunk data transfer sizes and optimized for speed and performance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>SDK Auto-detect</strong> - If you're using an out-of-date SDK, we'll automatically let you know that you need to update (by way of relevant error messaging).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sexier Splash Page</strong> - Includes an improved overview of our high level feature set, and looks damn good. View it <a href="http://hydra.agoragames.com/splash">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="still-to-come">Still to come</h2>

<p>Here is a list of the features that are currently under development, and that you'll be able to get your hands on soon:</p>

<p><strong>User Accounts</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Facebook account authorization</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Friends</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Facebook friend import</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Chat/Presence</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>First iteration of match/lobby chat functionality</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pricing / Payment Processing</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>First iteration of payment processing and account management</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to post questions on any of these features in our  <a href="http://support.agoragames.com/discussions/hydra-mobile-closed-beta-general-discussion">Beta Support Forum</a>, and continue to put our platform to the test. Thanks a ton!</p>

We also fixed this data leak with the 2.2.2 release of <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-python"> leaderboard-python</a>, our Python port of the leaderboard project. Finally, we released version 1.0.0 of <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-coffeescript">leaderboard-coffeescript</a> since it had been at full feature parity with the Ruby and Python implementations since it was started. And don't worry, the data leak was fixed in that project as well.</p>

In the 0.2.0 and 0.3.0 releases, we added an instrument to start exploring stats gathering with Mongoid as well as adding a wrapper for gauge, set, and count and fixing a bug with <code>Strumbar::Client.decrement</code> .</p>

<p>The Global Game Jam (GGJ) is the world's largest game jam event. Think of it as a hackathon focused on game development. It is the growth of an idea that in today's heavily connected world, we could com together, be creative, share experiences and express ourselves in a multitude of ways using videos - it if very universal.</p>

<p>The Albany chapter of the International Game Developers Association is the host for the GGJ in our area in upstate New York. Each year the crowd seems to grow, and this year was no different with over 40 people participating in the weekend long event being housed at SUNY Albany. This year's Game Jam took place on 6 different continents, in 63 countries, at 321 different sites. This truly is the definition of an international event.</p>

<p>The theme for this year's GGJ was "Heartbeat". There some projects that dealt with the theme by having the game adjust to how fast or slow you moved. If you moved faster, your heart rate increased along with objects in the game. If you slowed down for to long, you would die. One of the titles dealt with Social Anxiety for their game. The game's objective was to try to approach a certain person at a party you were attending. As you got closer to that person, it got harder to move and function, much like in real life for people who suffer from social anxieties.</p>

<p>Agora Games is a big believer in shared knowledge in the gaming and tech industry, which is evident by our extensive catalog of open sourced projects. We have been a proud sponsor of our local GGJ for a couple years now, and each year we send over a few people to check out the action and talk with the teams. Check out some photos below!</p>

<p>Hydra Mobile is the newest product from Agora Games and each week or so we’ll be releasing detailed information about features, an update from the beta, and anything else that you folks might want to know about Hydra Mobile. If we’re not talking about what you want to know about, let us know, and we’ll get that information to you info@agoragames.com.</p>

<h3 id="realtime-communication">Realtime Communication</h3>
<p>Hydra facilitates low-latency bidirectional communication of game events. Developers using Hydra can focus on the aspects of their multiplayer games that are unique and compelling, without having to manage the complex and costly network infrastructure that is often required to support those games.</p>

<p>This realtime communication will primarily be used in conjunction with our match service. With the power of cloud storage, matchmaking, and realtime messaging being in the same software stack, we can offer some amazing features.</p>

<p>The realtime server can also facilitate notifications that originate from our servers. These notifications can be anything from game invites to achievements awarded. Notifications which are sent via the realtime server can offer faster delivery and can contain larger payloads, although, notifications can also be sent via other channels if your game isn't using the realtime server.
### Beta Update
And, just as a quick update about the beta, we are preparing for a mid February launch of the expanded beta. Current beta users don't need to change anything, so no worries. If you're interested in getting into this next phase of our beta, please head to hydra.agoragames.com and click the sign up button. This next phase is still a closed beta, but we will be expanding the group of testers so we can begin load testing our systems.</p>

<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U39L4mEyIRc</p>

<p>For those of you that don't know, Ouya is a new gaming console that is powered by Android.  It's whole purpose is not to replace existing consoles, but to open up your TV to games from all types of developers, professional and indie alike.  They are even building the console so that the hardware can be easily modded by "hackers".    The removing of these boundaries from a console is most definitely going to allow some amazing games to come to your TV that you would have otherwise never played.</p>

<p>Yesterday, we received our Ouya dev kit in the mail, and immediately began uploading our own games.  We learned that not only does our new platform Hydra Mobile complement the Ouya model of being accessible to all developers, but it also is supported right out of the box!  We had our games running smoothly on our Ouya with profile stats, leaderboards, achievements &amp; match-making.</p>

<p><img alt="" alt="" width="1024" height="576" src="/assets/images/uploads/2013/01/ouya-1-1024x576-37f16b18.jpg" /></p>

<p>We are in full support of the Ouya team, and we look forward to supporting them in Hydra! <a href="http://hydra.agoragames.com">Sign up for our beta</a> now and see how you can integrate online services for Ouya!</p>
