Hack-a-thon!!</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Brian Corrigan</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>August 4th 3:00 PM: Excitement looms in their eyes as they await the fourth coming. An extraordinary combination of producers, interns, devs and more, unify to kick off the event of the century: Hack-A-thon 4. What is a Hack-a-thon you ask? Well, I&rsquo;m glad you did because only the foolish can live in ignorance of the mankind’s greatest celebration. It is only that moment that we’ve all dreamed of and considered impossible as children. The one moment that all of our parents told us about, but never truly believed we’d actually see. The period when you’re granted the highest level of honor and allowed 24 hours to work on any project that should strike your chord of desire. Brilliant, isn’t it? Now, the Agorians are an interesting people. Masters of the event is only the least that could be said of their Hack-a-thon abilities.</p> <p>Seeking the guiding words that will resound with them through the night’s perils, they sit restlessly as they await the official orders of the commander. <img width=300 height=224 src="/assets/images/uploads/2011/08/P1000429-300x224-b075bdca.jpg"/></p> <p>In a flash, he enters and our leader speaks. The speech rebounds off of the walls with power and echos through everyone’s mind. Simultaneously, he is demanding yet asking, telling yet not, requiring but not really. More or less something like this:</p> <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeNGVS2T_Rk</p> <p>Having internalized the words that would hype them up to a sense of self-belief and desire to work, the diverse people of the Agora rejoice. They then disperse to attack the monstrous tasks that they have chosen to resolve.</p> <p>Agust 4th 7:00PM: Although four hours have passed, the Agorians are still hard at work. Their determination prevents any pesky amount of noise or discomfort from discouraging them and preventing the success of the vision at hand. They have a task to fulfill and intend to do so. Bright eyed and in high spirit, they continue to bang away at their instruments.</p> <p><img width=300 height=224 src="/assets/images/uploads/2011/08/P1000440-300x224-74f8373c.jpg"/></p> <p>Some have even been inspired to a level where chairs are irrelevant; working while standing up, an unnecessary yet amazing triumph.</p> <p><img width=300 height=224 src="/assets/images/uploads/2011/08/P1000458-300x224-b0928dfd.jpg"/></p> <p>August 5th 1:00 AM: Signs of tire begins to appear as the day progresses&hellip;</p> <p><img width=300 height=225 src="/assets/images/uploads/2011/08/P1000447-300x225-8d78989b.jpg"/></p> <p>August 5th 5:00AM: The Agorians have taken the ultimate form of humankind. The zombie. Driven by their goals, the Agorian continues. He continues working without the slightest thought of rest.</p> <p><img width=300 height=168 src="/assets/images/uploads/2011/08/zombieatwork-300x168-5686849d.jpg"/></p> <p>Having diligently continued regardless of the obstacles, 3:00 PM arrives and the event is concluded. All of the Agorians meet at the same place that their tasks were appointed to speak of their successes and failures. Another grand Hack-a-thon has been successfully completed. Many accomplishments came out of this event and will be implemented into the natural flow of life soon.

Chef allows us to reliably manage our infrastructure by providing us with the ability to write code that describes how a server should be configured. While not perfect, it has served us well.</p> <p>Chef leverages CouchDB for it&rsquo;s datastore. CouchDB is &ldquo;NoSQL&rdquo; database product, similar in concept to MongoDB. CouchDB provides a lot of features and usability, but as a tradeoff for versioning, speed, and convenience it sacrifices disk space. In OpsCode&rsquo;s documentation, they do helpfully point out in the <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/CouchDB+Administration+for+Chef+Server">&ldquo;CouchDB Administration for Chef Server&rdquo; page</a> that you should periodically run a Compaction. Basically what this does is remove some of the older versions of documents.</p> <p>Following their advice, we set it up as a weekly cron (in our Cron cookbook, naturally), and so it looks like this:</p> <pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">cron</span> <span class="s1">'Compact Chef DB'</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">user</span> <span class="s1">'nobody'</span>
  <span class="n">weekday</span> <span class="s1">'1'</span>
  <span class="n">hour</span> <span class="s1">'4'</span>
  <span class="n">minute</span> <span class="s1">'0'</span>
  <span class="n">command</span> <span class="s1">'curl -X POST http://localhost:5984/chef/_compact'</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre> <p>which results in a crontab entry that looks like this:</p> <pre class="highlight plaintext"><code># Chef Name: Compact Chef DB
 0 4 \* \* 1 curl -X POST http://localhost:5984/chef/_compact
</code></pre> <p>One fine summer morning I came in one morning to several thousand emails saying &ldquo;Chef Run Failed.&rdquo; This, as you may understand, severely degraded my opinion of the morning.</p> <p>Cue the Swedish Chef crying &ldquo;Bork Bork Bork!&rdquo;</p> <p>After I determined that a full disk was the problem and deleting an old unneeded backup file to get some headroom, I found that the biggest contributor was the /var/lib/couchdb/0.10.0/.chef_design directory.</p> <pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>root@chefserver:/var/lib/couchdb/0.10.0/.chef_design# ls -lh

</code></pre> <p>Well, that was a significant but only partial win. Why do I still have 70GB in .view files?</p> <p>What Opscode hasn&rsquo;t told us about is that CouchDB has a thing called &ldquo;Views&rdquo;, and these can - over time - come to take up space. A lot of space. (CouchDB views are the &ldquo;primary tool used for querying and reporting on CouchDB documents&rdquo; according to the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Introduction_to_CouchDB_views">CouchDB Wiki</a>.) Opscode also hadn&rsquo;t mentioned that CouchDB says that these, too, need to be compacted.</p> <p>The good folks on the internet, notably the CouchDB docs and a question on StackOverflow <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/3498856/428779">&ldquo;CouchDB .view file growing out of control&rdquo;</a>.</p> <p>Among our findings we came upon this link to the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Compaction/#View_compaction">Compaction page in the CouchDB Documentation</a>.</p> <p>My compatriot Jeff Hagadorn and I were both looking into identifing the design view names, and he beat me to the solution:</p> <pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>bash -c \'for x in checksums clients cookbooks data_bags environments id_map nodes roles sandboxes users; do curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:5984/chef/_compact/$x ; done\'
</code></pre> <p>(I had found a posting on the couchdbkit Google Group describing a script a user had written to solve this very problem <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/couchdbkit/browse_thread/thread/4bddc28c630d73e0?pli=1">here</a>, if you prefer a Python-based solution which doesn&rsquo;t require you to know your view names.)</p> <p>After doing that, our disk was in a much healthier state, and our chef-db-compact recipe now looks like this:</p> <pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cron 'Compact Chef DB' do
  user 'nobody'
  weekday '1'
  hour '4'
  minute '0'
  command 'curl -X POST http://localhost:5984/chef/_compact'
end

 cron 'Compact Chef Views' do
   user 'nobody'
   weekday '1'
   hour '5'
   minutes '0'
   command 'bash -c \'for x in checksums clients cookbooks data_bags environments id_map nodes roles sandboxes users; do curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:5984/chef/_compact/$x ; done\''
 end
</code></pre> <p>which produces a crontab that looks like this:</p> <pre class="highlight plaintext"><code># Chef Name: Compact Chef DB
 0 4 \* \* 1 curl -X POST http://localhost:5984/chef/_compact
 # Chef Name: Compact Chef Views
 0 5 \* \* 1 bash -c 'for x in checksums clients cookbooks data_bags environments id_map nodes roles sandboxes users; do curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:5984/chef/_compact/$x ; done'
</code></pre> <p>Now, you may suggest that we mount this location on a separate disk. The answer is that we had. /var/lib/couchdb is a separate 100GB physical disk. The problem was that /var/log is on the / partition, and that is only a 7GB disk. Once the views had filled their disk, the couchdb and chef logfiles had swelled with errors, and even mighty logrotate could only held them off for so long.</p> <p>Bear in mind that there was no impact to Production during this event; the only outcome was that new changes would not have been able to be pushed out via Chef, and a couple of filled inboxes. Nevertheless, this highlighted some of our flaws. The most important of which is that our monitoring of the server was imperfect, and we missed the alerts that the CouchDB disk was filling. Had we not missed those alerts we could have diagnosed this before it was a problem.</p> <p>As an aside, in addition to just alerting when disk reaches a certain capacity, you should also watch for sudden increases in utilization. If a particular disk normally runs at 20% capacity, but overnight a logfile swells the disk to 73%, it won&rsquo;t trigger your &ldquo;75% Full&rdquo; alert, but there is very likely a problem. One way to solve this is to record a &ldquo;previous percentage&rdquo; and compare that to the &ldquo;current percentage&rdquo; and alert in the event that there is a sudden increase.</p> <p>(NOTE: Server Names have been changed to protect the guilty.)</p> <p>UPDATE: I&rsquo;m notified by the Senior Systems Admin at Opscode that they have added these compactions to the <a href="https://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/blob/master/chef-server/recipes/default.rb">chef-server recipe</a>. Their implementation is quite a bit different than ours, but no matter.</p> <p>Harold &ldquo;Waldo&rdquo; Grunenwald Systems Engineer @gwaldo</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Aug 4 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/08/04/play-and-learn/">Play and Learn</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Brian Corrigan</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>When I was in grade school, I had your typical learning experience. My teacher stood up in front of us everyday and lectured about something that I usually found utterly boring. Fast-forward to college and its still pretty much the same ordeal, except now there are more students. Having said that, you can understand the significant amount of envy that poured from my eyes as I read about the new ways that classes are being taught; one of which is video games. Imagine you went to school excited everyday because calculus was no longer your boring system of numbers and formulas. To add to it, you’ve also sparked a desire to learn because it now becomes a fun challenge. Well that’s the situation with these 6th graders who are learning via the Jason Experiment.</p> <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5MQwErzo</p> <p>Of course, gaming is still dominated by its entertainment persona, but today we’ve seen it evolve and disperse into several different categories. One of these is education. Nowadays, a simple Google search will easily lead you to sites that specialize in this area. We’ve also witnessed it make its way into the mobile phone section and become one of the benchmarks of its category list. Educational gaming has been an aid in the Jason project, which focuses on learning through interactivity. The concept has also been used to support learning of subjects like energy flow or even adult popular subjects like politics or finance. Residing in its early stages of practical, productive use, can you see gaming evolving to become sufficient in other aspects of society?</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jul 29 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/07/29/who-reads-the-manuals/">Who Reads the Manuals?</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Leslie Brezslin</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>So I recently ordered my own copy of Mortal Kombat and it arrived just a few days ago. Once in my impatient hands, I savagely tore open its containing box without a fragment of mercy; ending with something similar to this:</p> <p><img width=150 height=150 src="/assets/images/uploads/2011/07/wool_box1-150x150-3c9257fa.jpg"/></p> <p>After that, I proceeded to remove the inferior plastic barrier that stood between me and the future of gory deaths that I’d be responsible for. Having taken care of the plastic with my razor sharp teeth, I pried open the casing open to reveal a fairly well decorated DVD and a booklet on the side. Naturally the booklet never experienced the faintest drop of my attention, but the DVD was pampered with the greatest of care. I removed it from its casing, popped it into my PS3 and enjoyed the awkwardly menacing side of me that enjoyed achieving the bloodiest of fatalities.</p> <p>Today, with most things, you normally learn as you go along. Somehow, I find myself remembering how I use to value those little booklets that I now show no love to. In the past, before delicately removing the DVD, I would have carefully removed the manual and used it to avoid the learning curve. Now, I realize that it had been a long time since I had read a game manual and will probably be an even longer time before I read another one. So I wonder, are game manuals worth it or have they become a waste of our limited resources? I personally think they should be available on the website or on the game disk. Of course, I haven’t ruled out that I may be the only one who doesn’t care for the manuals, so let me know your thoughts on our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/agoragames">Facebook</a> or below!</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jul 25 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/07/25/gaming-through-the-ages/">Gaming through the ages</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Leslie Brezslin</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>An overly sized brick that weighed a ton in my hands, comprising of a 2D, black and white screen and some buttons. That’s exactly how the six years old me would have described a Gameboy. Even with its primitive characteristics, the Gameboy is a feature in an evolutionary timeline that started many years before its arrival. If we go back to the beginning of human time, I’m sure that you’d be able to find some relative of gaming regardless of how basic. Competition and play are part of human nature, so whether it was punching wholes in the ground or killing the most mammoths, games can easily be made of anything.</p> <p>A game is defined as: an amusement, pastime or an activity, which requires skill and is usually some form of competition. Of course, by that definition not many things are subject to exclusion, but a search on Wikipedia or Google nowadays assumes a video game reference. Since man started tracking time, the earliest forms date back to 3000BC, one of which was a simple game of dice. Additionally, they were used then as they are today, as your common pastime for amusement or for competitive/ gambling purposes. Using the Romans as a prime example, they even had what became known as professional gamblers and eventually prohibition laws.</p> <p>Nowadays gaming has evolved into different categories. These include but are not limited to card games, board games, sports and the popular video games. Video games have also gone as far as merging all categories and changing the way they are experienced. Consider an ancient game like chess for example; it can now be played in a new environment without the physical board. Video games go as far back as the 1940s in early cathode ray tube-based missile defense systems. Originally designed for mainframe computers, videogames later expanded into consoles, personal computers and handhelds.</p> <p>Today, society has made it hard to fight a gaming addiction because they’re virtually everywhere. Most people have access to computers that undoubtedly hosts them, consoles have gotten cheaper, more affordable and best of all (depending on who you ask), they’ve invaded the mobile phone area. Some of the phone game graphics even rival popular handheld console systems. Hardware in systems is becoming more powerful and will continue to advance as time goes on. Today, we have consoles that offer 3d technology and some as far as virtual reality. I wonder what’s next, brain chips that let your mind be the console, maybe? Anyhow, for those of us that were old enough to enjoy them, I ask which was better, Gameboy, Atari or Game Gear. I personally vote for the Gameboy.

Videogames &lt;= Art? </a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Leslie Brezslin</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that there are some who hesitate when it comes to positively correlating video games and art.  Of course a statement like there is an art to playing (insert game) is invalid, but what about the finished product itself? This quote “Video games can never be art” by Roger Ebert has me stumped because games are simply hybrids of the art we take for granted everyday. For some, to appreciate a compilation,  one must examine each of the individual parts. To begin, what is art?</p> <p>Wikipedia describes art as “the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power”. Although this definition doesn’t go into specifics, there are many mediums through which art (specifically modern art) is experienced. Other than the two mentioned, some of the others include but aren’t limited to music, photography, literacy and motion pictures.</p> <p>My definition of an artist is a person who creates expressive works through available tools and mediums. Consider a composer, while Mason William&rsquo;s choice was the acoustic guitar, Jimmy Hendrix made a name for himself with the electric guitar.  The question is however, with the broad spectrum of tools that mankind has developed through the centuries, where do we draw the line between what’s art and what’s not?</p> <p>Painting, a classic art, liberates the trappings of the imagination by providing a platform for recreation and self-expression. Painting has gone from cave walls to the Mona Lisa over the years and below is an example by Johannes Vermeer called “the view of Delft”:</p> <p><img width=300 height=250 src="/assets/images/uploads/2011/07/Vermeer-view-of-delft-300x250-849fff04.jpg"/></p> <p>Now consider this work from one of the scenes in Brink:</p> <p><img width=300 height=136 src="/assets/images/uploads/2011/07/City-from-brink-300x136-7db70851.jpg"/></p> <p>This is an artist’s imagination of a world that doesn’t even exist. Regardless of the tools used to create it, the realism and openness to interpretation is at least similar to that of Vermeer. I regard re-creation and imagination as residing on two different planes of creativity. In my opinion, to paint something as it is in front of you isn’t as challenging as painting something as it could be. The interactivity of that world that games allow, tell a story but its brilliance isn’t limited to there. Lets take a motion picture. In this example, we’ll use a scene in a movie that derived from the book “Black Hawk Down” by <em>Mark Bowden.</em> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEGSQl9dDG0</p> <p>Compare this same scene to the popular video game Call of Duty:</p> <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-Kt83WmJec</p> <p>Will anyone  argue that films aren’t art? Black Hawk Down, won academy awards for its editing and sound; the aesthetics of the film. Undoubtedly, popping in a video you game will bring you very similar characteristics including performances. While Black Hawk Down is an expression of the battle of Mogadishu, COD is a portrayal of World War II. Although subjected to opinion, the only overlaying difference between the two, is the way they are experienced.</p> <p>They say when you wish to study emotion, you should consult an actor or musician, because it’s the true core of their professions. Music affects the mood and can be found in the background of most if not all films. It helps carry the scene and guide the audience as to how they should be feeling at any point in the plot. In the gaming world, before speech was a norm, music ruled all platforms and represented ninety percent of the sound that would be seen in games (the other ten percent representing the attempts at sound effects). Today, games have grown to feature both.  Some compositions have even grown to become so popular as to ignite re-creations or rearrangements (a feature that was only popular with historic classical pieces or pop music). Take for example the Kingdom Hearts theme song, Dearly Beloved: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g25QXnhVijQ Now compare that simplistic yet beautiful melody to this is composition by Kyle Landry: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ0E3dsHRV4</p> <p>Like the videos above, a quick search on Youtube bears many results of personalized variations; a growing arena. After all, what is art if not versatile enough to allow you to relate or re-express it as you see it?</p> <p>As stated by Kellee Santiago in her TED <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9y6MYDSAww">talk</a>, games are the cave paintings of what it can and probably will become. Although I agree that we&rsquo;ve only scratched the surface, I think that games aren’t the cave paintings but the evolution of the chicken scratch. It goes further than its predecessors in individualizing the experiences and allowing for a broader range of interpretations. Games are no longer just coded pixels, they&rsquo;re stories, paintings, and compositions. The code only allows them to mobilize and be experienced in a different way than the mediums before it. You can&rsquo;t mix all of the components of art together and disregard the hybrid as something different than its parent class. So are games works of art? yes! if you disagree, let me know in the comments below or on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/agoragames">twitter</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jul 20 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/07/20/soonatra-coming-soon-pages-on-sinatra/">Soonatra - 'Coming Soon' pages on Sinatra</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Logan Koester</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>I was recently tasked with creating a “coming soon” page for a new project. The requirements were the usual:</p> <ul> <li>Some description of the project features</li> <li>A form to signup for an email list / invites</li> <li>Display a few posts from an RSS feed</li> <li>Show some screenshots of what we’re building to collect early feedback</li> </ul> <p>We&rsquo;ve also been increasing our focus on A/B testing (aka &ldquo;split testing&rdquo;), so I wanted a way to try out different headlines and see which angle users find most interesting.</p> <p>This all sounds well and good, but it is very frustrating to take time away from the beginning of an exciting new project to invest in a page that will only be online for a few short weeks.</p> <p>I decided I don’t ever want to do it again, so I created  <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/soonatra">Soonatra</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/soonatra">Soonatra</a> is a simple  <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>-based framework for creating these pages quickly.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/soonatra">Soonatra</a> reduces the steps involved to: - Create a mailing list (we’re using  <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a>) - Choose some colors/graphics that fit well with your brand - Write the page copy and set an RSS feed url. - Deploy to a free  <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> account and park your domain.</p> <p>It is easy to extend and manage multiple themes thanks to  <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>, and does not require a database, instead using  <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> for RSS feed consumption and tracking A/B test results.</p> <p>You can fork the git repo and have your site up and running in minutes.</p> <p>See  <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/soonatra/blob/master/README.textile">README.textile</a> for all the juicy details.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jul 20 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/07/20/a-redis-cache-for-rss-consumption/">A Redis cache for RSS consumption</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Logan Koester</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>﻿If you’ve ever wanted to include some data from an RSS/Atom feed on a page from Ruby, you’ve probably run into this problem:</p> <blockquote> <p>It’s completely unreasonable to hammer the feed provider with a request every time the page is rendered, but it’s no more reasonable to use a big relational database like MySQL just to cache some stupid tweets or blog posts, especially if your application wouldn’t otherwise need one. But apparently this layer of persistance has been deemed out-of-scope by the creators of popular RSS consumer libraries such as  <a href="https://github.com/pauldix/feedzirra">Feedzirra</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>So I wrote a little gem called  <a href="https://github.com/logankoester/feedzirra-redis/">feedzirra-redis</a> to take care of this as transparently as possible. You can use it just like you would  <a href="https://github.com/pauldix/feedzirra">Feedzirra</a> normally, but your feeds and entries do not disappear at the end of the script, so you can do the dirty work from a Rakefile via cron instead of in the web request/response cycle while your users impatiently twiddle their thumbs.</p> <p><strong>Installation</strong></p> <p>$ gem install feedzirra-redis</p> <p> </p> <p>See the  <a href="https://github.com/logankoester/feedzirra-redis/blob/master/README.markdown">README</a> and  <a href="https://github.com/logankoester/feedzirra-redis/blob/master/test/test_feedzirra-redis.rb">test suite</a> for example usage.</p> <p>Enjoy!</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jul 8 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/07/08/1559/">June Recap</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>As June comes to an end, we remember that it brought more to us than the official start of summer. Below is a high level view of just a few of the projects and events that took place this month.</p> <p><strong>MLG Columbus</strong> Lets start off with our biggest event, MLG Columbus. This month’s Pro circuit was held during the weekend of June 3-5 in Columbus Ohio and obtained notable success. Throughout the weekend, nearly 15 thousand people showed up to support their favorite gamers. That however, was nothing near the 22.5 million people who streamed the event from their computers. With the major updates we made to our systems, we formulated the equation for a very successful pro circuit event that tromped the ones before it.</p> <p>﻿<strong>Git</strong></p> <p>This month we added a few new goodies to our Github portfolio accessible at github.com/agoragames. Some of which include:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/haigha"><strong>Haigha</strong></a></p> <p>Haigha provides a simple to use client library for interacting with AMQP brokers. It currently supports the 0.9.1 protocol and is integration tested against the latest RabbitMQ 2.4.1 (see <a href="http://dev.rabbitmq.com/wiki/Amqp091Errata">errata</a>). Haigha is a descendant of py-amqplib and owes much to its developers.</p> <p>The goals of haigha are performance, simplicity, and adherence to the form and function of the AMQP protocol. It adds a few useful features, such as the ChannelPool class and Channel.publish_synchronous, to ease use of powerful features in real-world applications.</p> <p>By default, Haigha operates in a completely asynchronous mode, relying on callbacks to notify application code of responses from the broker. Where applicable, nowait defaults to True. The application code is welcome to call a series of methods, and Haigha will manage the stack and synchronous handshakes in the event loop.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/gondola"><strong>Gondola</strong></a></p> <p>Gondola is a ruby gem which aims to bridge the gap between two very prominent, open source, quality assurance tools, Selenium IDE and Sauce Labs. Many quality assurance professionals who don&rsquo;t have the necessary technical skills to write Selenium webdriver-based unit tests prefer to do their web regression testing using solely the Selenium IDE and then exporting those test cases by some means to Sauce Labs&#39; system.</p> <p>Gondola offers an easier and more convenient system for dispatching tests written in Selenium IDE to a Sauce Labs account. Gondola transforms the html that Selenium IDE produces by default and ships it to Sauce Labs across a number of browsers in parallel. Test suites and projects can be easily organized with simple file directory structures.</p> <p>Beyond the console application that comes with the gem, Gondola offers a small API for integrating Gondola&rsquo;s features into custom web apps. This allows a user to bring Gondola&rsquo;s simplicity into an existing testing suite or a new web application. Specifically, we have a plan to write a sample Gondola web app to demonstrate its power.</p> <p>We’ve also added updates to the projects that were the deliverables of previous months. Check out the Git page for a full list.</p> <p><strong>Webby Awards</strong></p> <p>The Webby Award is the leading international award honoring excellence on the Internet. This year we won two webby awards, one for lifestyle and another for the other for games.</p> <p><strong>Mortal Kombat Fight Stick</strong></p> <p>This classic trophy is a gift from Warner Bros for the work that we did on the latest Mortal Kombat game. Currently, we are powering the stats on their website and are responsible for the creation of their in-game chat features.</p> <p><a href="http://tv.majorleaguegaming.com"><strong>MLG.tv</strong></a></p> <p>So MLG.tv has received numerous updates and features over the course of this month. One of those, is the user generated content feature with options such as SSO/login integration_, _video uploads, user channels and a user videos page. We’ve also added video rating and moderation capabilities along with several addition improvements on the back end of the site.</p> <p><strong>MLG Store</strong></p> <p>There have been quite a few updates deployed to the MLG store, making it simple and enjoyable to get the things you want. We’ve also heightened security in order to protect your information and prevent fraud while fostering a painless checkout process.</p> <p>These are just six of the things that went on during the sixth month of the year. Here at Agora we’re constantly working and implementing new back-end and front-end updates. Thank you to the team for a productive month and to you our followers for your support.

Out of Dunkin Donuts, a young boy excitedly ran up to me. After catching his breath, he goes, “excuse me, do you compete in the MLG?” At that point I had gotten towed and was on the phone with the police so I simply shook my head no.</p> <p>Think back to high school; remember the assortment of social groups? To name a few, we had the jocks with expectations of college sports and the major leagues. Also, we had the dramatic arts students who hoped for the big break that would land them fame and fortune. There’s no forgetting the music students who dreamed of being rap or rock stars and finally, the nerds. Sadly there was no glamorous expectation for the nerds. They were expected to do your normal jobs, working for big companies or starting their own.</p> <p>Even when you considered the earning potential, there was still that essence of glory that was missing, unless you discovered something great. This however, started to change about eight years ago when Sundance started MLG. Today MLG is accurately described as a huge concert for gamers. The last event housed almost 15,000 while streaming to an audience of at least 22.5 million.</p> <p>After getting my car, I started thinking of the influence that MLG has on the new generation. To young kids, MLG is right up there with other professional leagues such as the NBA or the NFL. MLG already opens doors to huge opportunities for sponsorships and endorsement deals and will only go further. Additionally, as we attract more sponsors and fans, the growth potential becomes unlimited.</p> <p>Now consider the change that brings to that same high school scene. Finally, a means of recognition for those who lack the interest or ability to play sports, act out a scene or please a crowd with music. Now when you’re told to do something for your future, it’s arguable that you are investing in your future. So, to those siting on the couch pwning their friends in Halo, your path to glory awaits.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-pagination> <ul class=inline-list> <li> <a href="/blog/page/16/">« Older entries </a></li> <li>Page 15 of 28</li> <li> <a href="/blog/page/14/">Newer entries » </a></li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class='columns large-3'> <div class=blog-archives-sidebar> <h2>Blog archives</h2> <h3> <a href="/blog/2015/">2015</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2015/10/">October 2015</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2015/03/">March 2015</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2015/01/">January 2015</a> </li> </ul> <h3> <a href="/blog/2014/">2014</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/12/">December 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/11/">November 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/10/">October 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/08/">August 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/07/">July 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/06/">June 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/04/">April 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/03/">March 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/02/">February 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/01/">January 2014</a> </li> </ul> <h3> <a href="/blog/2013/">2013</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/11/">November 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/10/">October 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/09/">September 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/08/">August 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/07/">July 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/06/">June 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/05/">May 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/04/">April 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/03/">March 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/02/">February 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/01/">January 2013</a> </li> </ul> <h3> <a href="/blog/2012/">2012</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/12/">December 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/11/">November 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/10/">October 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/09/">September 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/08/">August 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/07/">July 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/06/">June 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/05/">May 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/04/">April 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/03/">March 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/02/">February 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/01/">January 2012</a> </li> </ul> <h3> <a href="/blog/2011/">2011</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/10/">October 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/09/">September 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/08/">August 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/07/">July 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/06/">June 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/05/">May 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/04/">April 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/03/">March 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/02/">February 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/01/">January 2011</a> </li> </ul> <h3> <a href="/blog/2010/">2010</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/12/">December 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/11/">November 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/10/">October 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/09/">September 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/08/">August 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/07/">July 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/06/">June 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/05/">May 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/04/">April 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/03/">March 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/02/">February 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/01/">January 2010</a> </li> </ul> <h3> <a href="/blog/2009/">2009</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/12/">December 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/11/">November 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/10/">October 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/09/">September 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/08/">August 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/07/">July 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/06/">June 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/05/">May 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/04/">April 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/03/">March 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/02/">February 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/01/">January 2009</a> </li> </ul> <h3> <a href="/blog/2008/">2008</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2008/11/">November 2008</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2008/10/">October 2008</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2008/09/">September 2008</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2008/08/">August 2008</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> <script src="/assets/javascripts/app-8d34dc05.js" async=true></script> </body> </html>
