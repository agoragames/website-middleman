Chef allows us to reliably manage our infrastructure by providing us with the ability to write code that describes how a server should be configured. While not perfect, it has served us well.</p> <p>Chef leverages CouchDB for it's datastore. CouchDB is "NoSQL" database product, similar in concept to MongoDB. CouchDB provides a lot of features and usability, but as a tradeoff for versioning, speed, and convenience it sacrifices disk space. In OpsCode's documentation, they do helpfully point out in the <a href="//wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/CouchDB+Administration+for+Chef+Server">"CouchDB Administration for Chef Server" page</a> that you should periodically run a Compaction. Basically what this does is remove some of the older versions of documents.</p> <p>Following their advice, we set it up as a weekly cron (in our Cron cookbook, naturally), and so it looks like this:</p> <p><code>ruby cron 'Compact Chef DB' do user 'nobody' weekday '1' hour '4' minute '0' command 'curl -X POST http://localhost:5984/chef/_compact' end </code></p> <p>which results in a crontab entry that looks like this:</p> <p><code> # Chef Name: Compact Chef DB 0 4 \* \* 1 curl -X POST http://localhost:5984/chef/_compact </code></p> <p>One fine summer morning I came in one morning to several thousand emails saying "Chef Run Failed." This, as you may understand, severely degraded my opinion of the morning.</p> <p>Cue the Swedish Chef crying "Bork Bork Bork!"</p> <p>After I determined that a full disk was the problem and deleting an old unneeded backup file to get some headroom, I found that the biggest contributor was the /var/lib/couchdb/0.10.0/.chef_design directory.</p> <p><code> root@chefserver:/var/lib/couchdb/0.10.0/.chef_design# ls -lh total 96G -rw-rw-r-- 1 couchdb couchdb 30M 2011-07-21 18:26 07ccb0c12664d1f1ca746003182b521a.view -rw-r--r-- 1 couchdb couchdb 1.7G 2011-05-11 12:03 178087e2a7c06ff437482555acf60bab.view -rw-rw-r-- 1 couchdb couchdb 8.5G 2011-07-22 08:24 18757f7428c465dd0504ac3d5d7ce577.view -rw-rw-r-- 1 couchdb couchdb 8.9G 2011-07-22 08:24 367772ed026257ff1f88a1011576c9c3.view -rw-rw-r-- 1 couchdb couchdb 6.6M 2011-07-21 15:52 3970d32b6acb424bb4d19684bdf9aff1.view -rw-r--r-- 1 couchdb couchdb 8.6M 2011-07-22 08:11 91188e3c7d61bdf079eee6ca719be05c.view -rw-rw-r-- 1 couchdb couchdb 6.0G 2011-03-16 16:44 9f39fce5f578a23cc8cad7b3fe9b8ce9.view -rw-r--r-- 1 couchdb couchdb 1.4G 2011-07-22 08:24 af280ad217f6edca6276d1d1bcbc069d.view -rw-rw-r-- 1 couchdb couchdb 19G 2011-05-11 12:00 b96879fe1377e2b91f228109f3aac384.view -rw-rw-r-- 1 couchdb couchdb 565K 2011-07-20 09:31 be708387555557a5b4886292346da6bb.view -rw-rw-r-- 1 couchdb couchdb 3.0M 2011-07-20 11:27 d381d1f4b207dc3d9624720a7e88f881.view -rw-r--r-- 1 couchdb couchdb 51G 2011-07-22 08:20 fe06cf9119d23dd7fec2492b79e7ebef.view </code></p> <p>I was surprised that there was so much disk use, since we had been running the Chef Compactions, and expected this kind of thing to be taken care of.

Why do I still have 70GB in .view files?</p> <p>What Opscode hasn't told us about is that CouchDB has a thing called "Views", and these can - over time - come to take up space. A lot of space. (CouchDB views are the "primary tool used for querying and reporting on CouchDB documents" according to the <a href="//wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Introduction_to_CouchDB_views">CouchDB Wiki</a>.) Opscode also hadn't mentioned that CouchDB says that these, too, need to be compacted.</p> <p>The good folks on the internet, notably the CouchDB docs and a question on StackOverflow <a href="//stackoverflow.com/q/3498856/428779">"CouchDB .view file growing out of control"</a>.</p> <p>Among our findings we came upon this link to the <a href="//wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Compaction/#View_compaction">Compaction page in the CouchDB Documentation</a>.</p> <p>My compatriot Jeff Hagadorn and I were both looking into identifing the design view names, and he beat me to the solution:</p> <p><code> bash -c \'for x in checksums clients cookbooks data_bags environments id_map nodes roles sandboxes users; do curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:5984/chef/_compact/$x ; done\' </code></p> <p>(I had found a posting on the couchdbkit Google Group describing a script a user had written to solve this very problem <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/couchdbkit/browse_thread/thread/4bddc28c630d73e0?pli=1">here</a>, if you prefer a Python-based solution which doesn't require you to know your view names.)</p> <p>After doing that, our disk was in a much healthier state, and our chef-db-compact recipe now looks like this:</p> <p>``` cron 'Compact Chef DB' do user 'nobody' weekday '1' hour '4' minute '0' command 'curl -X POST http://localhost:5984/chef/_compact' end</p> <p>cron 'Compact Chef Views' do user 'nobody' weekday '1' hour '5' minutes '0' command 'bash -c 'for x in checksums clients cookbooks data_bags environments id_map nodes roles sandboxes users; do curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:5984/chef/_compact/$x ; done'' end ```</p> <p>which produces a crontab that looks like this:</p> <p><code> # Chef Name: Compact Chef DB 0 4 \* \* 1 curl -X POST http://localhost:5984/chef/_compact # Chef Name: Compact Chef Views 0 5 \* \* 1 bash -c 'for x in checksums clients cookbooks data_bags environments id_map nodes roles sandboxes users; do curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:5984/chef/_compact/$x ; done' </code></p> <p>Now, you may suggest that we mount this location on a separate disk. The answer is that we had. /var/lib/couchdb is a separate 100GB physical disk. The problem was that /var/log is on the / partition, and that is only a 7GB disk. Once the views had filled their disk, the couchdb and chef logfiles had swelled with errors, and even mighty logrotate could only held them off for so long.</p> <p>Bear in mind that there was no impact to Production during this event; the only outcome was that new changes would not have been able to be pushed out via Chef, and a couple of filled inboxes. Nevertheless, this highlighted some of our flaws. The most important of which is that our monitoring of the server was imperfect, and we missed the alerts that the CouchDB disk was filling. Had we not missed those alerts we could have diagnosed this before it was a problem.</p> <p>As an aside, in addition to just alerting when disk reaches a certain capacity, you should also watch for sudden increases in utilization. If a particular disk normally runs at 20% capacity, but overnight a logfile swells the disk to 73%, it won't trigger your "75% Full" alert, but there is very likely a problem. One way to solve this is to record a "previous percentage" and compare that to the "current percentage" and alert in the event that there is a sudden increase.</p> <p>(NOTE: Server Names have been changed to protect the guilty.)</p> <p>UPDATE: I'm notified by the Senior Systems Admin at Opscode that they have added these compactions to the <a href="https://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/blob/master/chef-server/recipes/default.rb">chef-server recipe</a>. Their implementation is quite a bit different than ours, but no matter.</p> <p>Harold "Waldo" Grunenwald Systems Engineer @gwaldo</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Aug 4 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/08/04/play-and-learn/">Play and Learn</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Brian Corrigan</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>When I was in grade school, I had your typical learning experience. My teacher stood up in front of us everyday and lectured about something that I usually found utterly boring. Fast-forward to college and its still pretty much the same ordeal, except now there are more students. Having said that, you can understand the significant amount of envy that poured from my eyes as I read about the new ways that classes are being taught; one of which is video games. Imagine you went to school excited everyday because calculus was no longer your boring system of numbers and formulas. To add to it, you’ve also sparked a desire to learn because it now becomes a fun challenge. Well that’s the situation with these 6th graders who are learning via the Jason Experiment.</p> <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tB5MQwErzo</p> <p>Of course, gaming is still dominated by its entertainment persona, but today we’ve seen it evolve and disperse into several different categories. One of these is education. Nowadays, a simple Google search will easily lead you to sites that specialize in this area. We’ve also witnessed it make its way into the mobile phone section and become one of the benchmarks of its category list. Educational gaming has been an aid in the Jason project, which focuses on learning through interactivity. The concept has also been used to support learning of subjects like energy flow or even adult popular subjects like politics or finance. Residing in its early stages of practical, productive use, can you see gaming evolving to become sufficient in other aspects of society?</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jul 29 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/07/29/who-reads-the-manuals/">Who Reads the Manuals?</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Leslie Brezslin</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>So I recently ordered my own copy of Mortal Kombat and it arrived just a few days ago. Once in my impatient hands, I savagely tore open its containing box without a fragment of mercy; ending with something similar to this:</p> <p><img alt="" width=150 height=150 src="/assets/images/uploads/2011/07/wool_box1-150x150-3c9257fa.jpg"/></p> <p>After that, I proceeded to remove the inferior plastic barrier that stood between me and the future of gory deaths that I’d be responsible for. Having taken care of the plastic with my razor sharp teeth, I pried open the casing open to reveal a fairly well decorated DVD and a booklet on the side. Naturally the booklet never experienced the faintest drop of my attention, but the DVD was pampered with the greatest of care. I removed it from its casing, popped it into my PS3 and enjoyed the awkwardly menacing side of me that enjoyed achieving the bloodiest of fatalities.</p> <p>Today, with most things, you normally learn as you go along. Somehow, I find myself remembering how I use to value those little booklets that I now show no love to. In the past, before delicately removing the DVD, I would have carefully removed the manual and used it to avoid the learning curve. Now, I realize that it had been a long time since I had read a game manual and will probably be an even longer time before I read another one. So I wonder, are game manuals worth it or have they become a waste of our limited resources? I personally think they should be available on the website or on the game disk. Of course, I haven’t ruled out that I may be the only one who doesn’t care for the manuals, so let me know your thoughts on our <a href="//www.facebook.com/agoragames">Facebook</a> or below!</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jul 25 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/07/25/gaming-through-the-ages/">Gaming through the ages</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Leslie Brezslin</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>An overly sized brick that weighed a ton in my hands, comprising of a 2D, black and white screen and some buttons. That’s exactly how the six years old me would have described a Gameboy. Even with its primitive characteristics, the Gameboy is a feature in an evolutionary timeline that started many years before its arrival. If we go back to the beginning of human time, I’m sure that you’d be able to find some relative of gaming regardless of how basic. Competition and play are part of human nature, so whether it was punching wholes in the ground or killing the most mammoths, games can easily be made of anything.</p> <p>A game is defined as: an amusement, pastime or an activity, which requires skill and is usually some form of competition. Of course, by that definition not many things are subject to exclusion, but a search on Wikipedia or Google nowadays assumes a video game reference. Since man started tracking time, the earliest forms date back to 3000BC, one of which was a simple game of dice. Additionally, they were used then as they are today, as your common pastime for amusement or for competitive/ gambling purposes. Using the Romans as a prime example, they even had what became known as professional gamblers and eventually prohibition laws.</p> <p>Nowadays gaming has evolved into different categories. These include but are not limited to card games, board games, sports and the popular video games. Video games have also gone as far as merging all categories and changing the way they are experienced. Consider an ancient game like chess for example; it can now be played in a new environment without the physical board. Video games go as far back as the 1940s in early cathode ray tube-based missile defense systems. Originally designed for mainframe computers, videogames later expanded into consoles, personal computers and handhelds.</p> <p>Today, society has made it hard to fight a gaming addiction because they’re virtually everywhere. Most people have access to computers that undoubtedly hosts them, consoles have gotten cheaper, more affordable and best of all (depending on who you ask), they’ve invaded the mobile phone area. Some of the phone game graphics even rival popular handheld console systems. Hardware in systems is becoming more powerful and will continue to advance as time goes on. Today, we have consoles that offer 3d technology and some as far as virtual reality. I wonder what’s next, brain chips that let your mind be the console, maybe? Anyhow, for those of us that were old enough to enjoy them, I ask which was better, Gameboy, Atari or Game Gear. I personally vote for the Gameboy.

Videogames &lt;= Art? </a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Leslie Brezslin</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>I've noticed that there are some who hesitate when it comes to positively correlating video games and art.  Of course a statement like there is an art to playing (insert game) is invalid, but what about the finished product itself? This quote “Video games can never be art” by Roger Ebert has me stumped because games are simply hybrids of the art we take for granted everyday. For some, to appreciate a compilation,  one must examine each of the individual parts. To begin, what is art?</p> <p>Wikipedia describes art as “the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power”. Although this definition doesn’t go into specifics, there are many mediums through which art (specifically modern art) is experienced. Other than the two mentioned, some of the others include but aren’t limited to music, photography, literacy and motion pictures.</p> <p>My definition of an artist is a person who creates expressive works through available tools and mediums. Consider a composer, while Mason William's choice was the acoustic guitar, Jimmy Hendrix made a name for himself with the electric guitar.  The question is however, with the broad spectrum of tools that mankind has developed through the centuries, where do we draw the line between what’s art and what’s not?</p> <p>Painting, a classic art, liberates the trappings of the imagination by providing a platform for recreation and self-expression. Painting has gone from cave walls to the Mona Lisa over the years and below is an example by Johannes Vermeer called “the view of Delft”:</p> <p><img alt="" width=300 height=250 src="/assets/images/uploads/2011/07/Vermeer-view-of-delft-300x250-849fff04.jpg"/></p> <p>Now consider this work from one of the scenes in Brink:</p> <p><img alt="" width=300 height=136 src="/assets/images/uploads/2011/07/City-from-brink-300x136-7db70851.jpg"/></p> <p>This is an artist’s imagination of a world that doesn’t even exist. Regardless of the tools used to create it, the realism and openness to interpretation is at least similar to that of Vermeer. I regard re-creation and imagination as residing on two different planes of creativity. In my opinion, to paint something as it is in front of you isn’t as challenging as painting something as it could be. The interactivity of that world that games allow, tell a story but its brilliance isn’t limited to there. Lets take a motion picture. In this example, we’ll use a scene in a movie that derived from the book “Black Hawk Down” by <em>Mark Bowden.</em> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEGSQl9dDG0</p> <p>Compare this same scene to the popular video game Call of Duty:</p> <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-Kt83WmJec</p> <p>Will anyone  argue that films aren’t art? Black Hawk Down, won academy awards for its editing and sound; the aesthetics of the film. Undoubtedly, popping in a video you game will bring you very similar characteristics including performances. While Black Hawk Down is an expression of the battle of Mogadishu, COD is a portrayal of World War II. Although subjected to opinion, the only overlaying difference between the two, is the way they are experienced.</p> <p>They say when you wish to study emotion, you should consult an actor or musician, because it’s the true core of their professions. Music affects the mood and can be found in the background of most if not all films. It helps carry the scene and guide the audience as to how they should be feeling at any point in the plot. In the gaming world, before speech was a norm, music ruled all platforms and represented ninety percent of the sound that would be seen in games (the other ten percent representing the attempts at sound effects). Today, games have grown to feature both.  Some compositions have even grown to become so popular as to ignite re-creations or rearrangements (a feature that was only popular with historic classical pieces or pop music). Take for example the Kingdom Hearts theme song, Dearly Beloved: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g25QXnhVijQ Now compare that simplistic yet beautiful melody to this is composition by Kyle Landry: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ0E3dsHRV4</p> <p>Like the videos above, a quick search on Youtube bears many results of personalized variations; a growing arena. After all, what is art if not versatile enough to allow you to relate or re-express it as you see it?</p> <p>As stated by Kellee Santiago in her TED <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9y6MYDSAww">talk</a>, games are the cave paintings of what it can and probably will become. Although I agree that we've only scratched the surface, I think that games aren’t the cave paintings but the evolution of the chicken scratch. It goes further than its predecessors in individualizing the experiences and allowing for a broader range of interpretations. Games are no longer just coded pixels, they're stories, paintings, and compositions. The code only allows them to mobilize and be experienced in a different way than the mediums before it. You can't mix all of the components of art together and disregard the hybrid as something different than its parent class. So are games works of art? yes! if you disagree, let me know in the comments below or on <a href="//www.twitter.com/agoragames">twitter</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jul 20 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/07/20/soonatra-coming-soon-pages-on-sinatra/">Soonatra - 'Coming Soon' pages on Sinatra</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Logan Koester</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>I was recently tasked with creating a “coming soon” page for a new project.

But apparently this layer of persistance has been deemed out-of-scope by the creators of popular RSS consumer libraries such as  <a href="https://github.com/pauldix/feedzirra">Feedzirra</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>So I wrote a little gem called  <a href="https://github.com/logankoester/feedzirra-redis/">feedzirra-redis</a> to take care of this as transparently as possible. You can use it just like you would  <a href="https://github.com/pauldix/feedzirra">Feedzirra</a> normally, but your feeds and entries do not disappear at the end of the script, so you can do the dirty work from a Rakefile via cron instead of in the web request/response cycle while your users impatiently twiddle their thumbs.</p> <p><strong>Installation</strong></p> <p>$ gem install feedzirra-redis</p> <p> </p> <p>See the  <a href="https://github.com/logankoester/feedzirra-redis/blob/master/README.markdown">README</a> and  <a href="https://github.com/logankoester/feedzirra-redis/blob/master/test/test_feedzirra-redis.rb">test suite</a> for example usage.</p> <p>Enjoy!</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jul 8 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/07/08/1559/">June Recap</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>As June comes to an end, we remember that it brought more to us than the official start of summer. Below is a high level view of just a few of the projects and events that took place this month.</p> <p><strong>MLG Columbus</strong> Lets start off with our biggest event, MLG Columbus. This month’s Pro circuit was held during the weekend of June 3-5 in Columbus Ohio and obtained notable success. Throughout the weekend, nearly 15 thousand people showed up to support their favorite gamers. That however, was nothing near the 22.5 million people who streamed the event from their computers. With the major updates we made to our systems, we formulated the equation for a very successful pro circuit event that tromped the ones before it.</p> <p>﻿<strong>Git</strong></p> <p>This month we added a few new goodies to our Github portfolio accessible at github.com/agoragames. Some of which include:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/haigha"><strong>Haigha</strong></a></p> <p>Haigha provides a simple to use client library for interacting with AMQP brokers. It currently supports the 0.9.1 protocol and is integration tested against the latest RabbitMQ 2.4.1 (see <a href="//dev.rabbitmq.com/wiki/Amqp091Errata">errata</a>). Haigha is a descendant of py-amqplib and owes much to its developers.</p> <p>The goals of haigha are performance, simplicity, and adherence to the form and function of the AMQP protocol. It adds a few useful features, such as the ChannelPool class and Channel.publish_synchronous, to ease use of powerful features in real-world applications.</p> <p>By default, Haigha operates in a completely asynchronous mode, relying on callbacks to notify application code of responses from the broker. Where applicable, nowait defaults to True. The application code is welcome to call a series of methods, and Haigha will manage the stack and synchronous handshakes in the event loop.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/gondola"><strong>Gondola</strong></a></p> <p>Gondola is a ruby gem which aims to bridge the gap between two very prominent, open source, quality assurance tools, Selenium IDE and Sauce Labs. Many quality assurance professionals who don't have the necessary technical skills to write Selenium webdriver-based unit tests prefer to do their web regression testing using solely the Selenium IDE and then exporting those test cases by some means to Sauce Labs' system.</p> <p>Gondola offers an easier and more convenient system for dispatching tests written in Selenium IDE to a Sauce Labs account. Gondola transforms the html that Selenium IDE produces by default and ships it to Sauce Labs across a number of browsers in parallel. Test suites and projects can be easily organized with simple file directory structures.</p> <p>Beyond the console application that comes with the gem, Gondola offers a small API for integrating Gondola's features into custom web apps. This allows a user to bring Gondola's simplicity into an existing testing suite or a new web application. Specifically, we have a plan to write a sample Gondola web app to demonstrate its power.</p> <p>We’ve also added updates to the projects that were the deliverables of previous months. Check out the Git page for a full list.</p> <p><strong>Webby Awards</strong></p> <p>The Webby Award is the leading international award honoring excellence on the Internet. This year we won two webby awards, one for lifestyle and another for the other for games.</p> <p><strong>Mortal Kombat Fight Stick</strong></p> <p>This classic trophy is a gift from Warner Bros for the work that we did on the latest Mortal Kombat game. Currently, we are powering the stats on their website and are responsible for the creation of their in-game chat features.</p> <p><a href="//tv.majorleaguegaming.com"><strong>MLG.tv</strong></a></p> <p>So MLG.tv has received numerous updates and features over the course of this month. One of those, is the user generated content feature with options such as SSO/login integration_, _video uploads, user channels and a user videos page. We’ve also added video rating and moderation capabilities along with several addition improvements on the back end of the site.</p> <p><strong>MLG Store</strong></p> <p>There have been quite a few updates deployed to the MLG store, making it simple and enjoyable to get the things you want. We’ve also heightened security in order to protect your information and prevent fraud while fostering a painless checkout process.</p> <p>These are just six of the things that went on during the sixth month of the year. Here at Agora we’re constantly working and implementing new back-end and front-end updates. Thank you to the team for a productive month and to you our followers for your support.

Out of Dunkin Donuts, a young boy excitedly ran up to me. After catching his breath, he goes, “excuse me, do you compete in the MLG?” At that point I had gotten towed and was on the phone with the police so I simply shook my head no.</p> <p>Think back to high school; remember the assortment of social groups? To name a few, we had the jocks with expectations of college sports and the major leagues. Also, we had the dramatic arts students who hoped for the big break that would land them fame and fortune. There’s no forgetting the music students who dreamed of being rap or rock stars and finally, the nerds. Sadly there was no glamorous expectation for the nerds. They were expected to do your normal jobs, working for big companies or starting their own.</p> <p>Even when you considered the earning potential, there was still that essence of glory that was missing, unless you discovered something great. This however, started to change about eight years ago when Sundance started MLG. Today MLG is accurately described as a huge concert for gamers. The last event housed almost 15,000 while streaming to an audience of at least 22.5 million.</p> <p>After getting my car, I started thinking of the influence that MLG has on the new generation. To young kids, MLG is right up there with other professional leagues such as the NBA or the NFL. MLG already opens doors to huge opportunities for sponsorships and endorsement deals and will only go further. Additionally, as we attract more sponsors and fans, the growth potential becomes unlimited.</p> <p>Now consider the change that brings to that same high school scene. Finally, a means of recognition for those who lack the interest or ability to play sports, act out a scene or please a crowd with music. Now when you’re told to do something for your future, it’s arguable that you are investing in your future. So, to those siting on the couch pwning their friends in Halo, your path to glory awaits.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jun 24 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/06/24/of-penguins-rabbits-and-buses/">Of Penguins, Rabbits and Buses</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Aaron Westendorf</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>Here at Agora we make use of dedicated hardware and virtual machines running on our providers' respective clouds. In recent months, we've moved our RabbitMQ hosts onto hardware because we found that we could far exceed the CPU capacity of our virtual machines and it was far cheaper to run a small cluster of hardware hosts than a giant cluster of VMs. We used an existing, underutilized host for our primary traffic while awaiting delivery and installation of a new pair servers. Expecting a simple plug-and-play swap, I set out to test the new hardware before we made the transition. What follows is a harrowing tale into the deepest depths of modern hardware architecture.</p> <p>Our current primary RabbitMQ host, leviathan, is a 24 core Intel Xeon X5650 running at 2.67GHz and fitted with 132GB of RAM. The machine hosts all our in-memory databases, such as Redis and Memcached, and is vastly underutilized at this time. RabbitMQ is run in a cluster with other nodes hosted on VMs to give us failover capacity.</p> <p>To replace its role as RabbitMQ host, we purchased artemis and hermes, two 24 core AMD Opteron 6172s running at 2.1GHz and fitted with 8GB of RAM each. Recent versions of RabbitMQ page queue backlogs to disk, and our traffic pattern and infrastructure validations are such that this amount or RAM is sufficient.</p> <p>At first, one might assume that the differences in processors would result in near-equal <a href="//www.bit-tech.net/hardware/cpus/2010/03/31/amd-opteron-6174-vs-intel-xeon-x5650-review/1">performance</a> for RabbitMQ. The Intel CPUs have faster clock cycles, but they rely on Hyper-Threading to present 24 logical cores to the operating system. The AMD CPUs are slower, but they present 24 hardware cores to the kernel. <a href="//www.centos.org/docs/5/html/5.2/Deployment_Guide/s2-proc-cpuinfo.html">Linux</a> reports 5333 bogomips for the Xeons, 4200 for the Opterons.</p> <p>Using <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/haigha">haigha</a>'s load testing <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/haigha/blob/master/scripts/stress_test">script</a>, we were astonished to discover that our brand-new hardware was almost 50% slower than our until-recently-brand-new Intel hardware! What could possibly have gone wrong?</p> <p>The test that we ran consisted of 3 VM clients, each with 4 cores, each running 3 instances of the standard configuration of the <code>stress_test</code> script of 500 channels looping messages over 500 queues. That is, 4500 channels and queues, each channel publishing a message as soon as it receives its previously published message. The test would run for a fixed period of time, usually a minute.</p> <p>Our investigation started simple enough. Using top and our new favorite, htop, we observed that the kernel was using a substantial portion of each cores capacity. We also observed that cores were underutilized, as htop clearly showed a visible gap on the right-hand side the CPU graphs. Though not scientific, it appeared to be a 10-30% loss. A bit of <a href="//www.theregister.co.uk/2010/04/20/ubuntu_server_10_04/">research</a> implied that the Ubuntu 10.04.2 kernel, 2.6.32, was perhaps released around the same time as our AMD chips, and may not fully support them. We tested the latest patches to that release, 2.6.32-32, but did not observe any improvement.</p> <p>Venturing into unknown territory, we installed the latest kernel backported from maverick, 2.6.35-25. We immediately observed an improvement in CPU usage, such that all cores were near 100% utilization. Sadly though, our message throughput remained nearly the same, as user space consumed only 40% of each core. Yet when comparing a single instance of <code>stress_test</code> , leviathan and artemis performed nearly equal. In no case were we able to induce any IO wait, which was to be expected since we weren't hitting disk. Why would 24 cores of AMD be so dramatically different than 24 cores of Intel?</p> <p>With the obvious problems ruled out and the latest kernel installed, I started to dig deeper into the architectural differences between the two companies' designs. Using <a href="//manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/natty/man1/lscpu.1.html">lscpu</a>, we can see two very different CPU designs.</p> <p>``` leviathan:~$ lscpu Architecture: x86_64 CPU op-mode(s): 32-bit, 64-bit CPU(s): 24 Thread(s) per core: 2 Core(s) per socket: 6 CPU socket(s): 2 NUMA node(s): 2 Vendor ID: GenuineIntel CPU family: 6 Model: 44 Stepping: 2 CPU MHz: 2666.806 Virtualization: VT-x L1d cache: 32K L1i cache: 32K L2 cache: 256K L3 cache: 12288K</p> <p>artemis:~$ lscpu Architecture: x86_64 CPU op-mode(s): 64-bit CPU(s): 24 Thread(s) per core: 1 Core(s) per socket: 12 CPU socket(s): 2 NUMA node(s): 4 Vendor ID: AuthenticAMD CPU family: 16 Model: 9 Stepping: 1 CPU MHz: 2100.172 Virtualization: AMD-V L1d cache: 64K L1i cache: 64K L2 cache: 512K L3 cache: 5118K ```</p> <p>The AMD CPUs have nearly double the amount of dedicated cache per core, but a much smaller (shared) L3 cache. Though this was clearly a fundamental difference, it did not seem adequate in explaining the vast amount of time that the kernel was consuming on each CPU. Yet the only reason why the kernel would be consuming so much time, without any IO wait, would be if it was waiting for something. What would Linux be waiting for that Intel was readily delivering?</p> <p>As I noted, our test was running 4500 unique channels and queues. In a <a href="//lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-discuss/2011-May/012991.html">reply</a> to a recent inquiry on the RabbitMQ mailing list, I learned that both channels and queues are allocated an Erlang process. A bit of searching and I found a useful <a href="//www.erlang.org/euc/08/euc_smp.pdf">paper</a>[PDF] on the early SMP support in Erlang R12B, circa 2008. The diagrams show a single run queue from which all schedulers pull the next process to run.</p> <p>By R13B, each scheduler had a <a href="//www.erlang.org/documentation/doc-5.7/doc/highlights.html">dedicated</a> run queue, vastly decreasing lock contention. Additionally, scheduling algorithms, and <a href="//www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#system_flag-2">configuration thereof</a>, were designed specifically to take advantage of the variety of SMP architectures. RabbitMQ is running on R14B01, and so it should have the latest in SMP optimizations, particularly with respect to <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Uniform_Memory_Access">NUMA</a>, which is how both Intel and AMD implement their SMP architectures.</p> <p>Linux is also NUMA-aware, and contains scheduling algorithms that try to pair the core that a process or thread will use with the NUMA node where its memory is allocated. Likewise, it tries to allocate memory on the same NUMA node as the process or thread that is requesting it. This was a topic area we were already familiar with, but in terms of <a href="//jcole.us/blog/archives/2010/09/28/mysql-swap-insanity-and-the-numa-architecture/">database applications</a> that consume most of system RAM. That clearly was not the case here, as RabbitMQ barely consumed 500MB under the stress test, and the memory is allocated on demand, and so was spread evenly across all NUMA nodes.</p> <p>So with hardware that benchmarked well, using recent releases of the Linux kernel and Erlang VM, and an application that used a small fraction of available RAM, RabbitMQ performed abysmally slow. What could possibly cause such behavior?</p> <p>The final piece of the puzzle lay in the nature of RabbitMQ itself. Though Erlang may try to pair a process with a node-bound scheduler, and Linux allocate memory on the same node as that scheduler, that's of little use in practice. When a message is read from a connection (itself a process) on a channel (also a process), the route of that message must be looked up in an mnesia-backed global table to determine which queue(s) the message should be copied to. Bits are allocated and written to for that queue (yet another process), and then any consumer of that queue - a channel - must read the bits before sending them out. In short, there is a near-0 chance that the bits necessary to fulfill a single publish-route-consume will be processed by the same scheduler, and a just-slightly-greater-than-0 chance that it will be processed by a scheduler on the same NUMA node. Even if the code is optimized to only copy messages as references, numerous reads and writes must acquire an exclusive lock on a NUMA nodes memory bus.</p> <p>So what's the difference between Intel and AMD NUMA implementations?</p> <p>``` leviathan:~$ numactl -H available: 2 nodes (0-1) node 0 cpus: 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 node 0 size: 65525 MB node 0 free: 59013 MB node 1 cpus: 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 node 1 size: 65535 MB node 1 free: 59787 MB node distances: node 0 1 0: 10 20 1: 20 10</p> <p>artemis:~$ numactl -H available: 4 nodes (0-3) node 0 cpus: 0 2 4 6 8 10 node 0 size: 2047 MB node 0 free: 1621 MB node 1 cpus: 12 14 16 18 20 22 node 1 size: 2044 MB node 1 free: 1758 MB node 2 cpus: 13 15 17 19 21 23 node 2 size: 2048 MB node 2 free: 1806 MB node 3 cpus: 1 3 5 7 9 11 node 3 size: 2047 MB node 3 free: 1874 MB node distances: node 0 1 2 3 0: 10 20 20 20 1: 20 10 20 20 2: 20 20 10 20 3: 20 20 20 10 ```</p> <p>The AMD cores are split across four nodes, whereas the Intel cores only use two. In the case where a process uses all cores equally, there is a 50% probability of a memory operation being local on a Xeon processor, but only a 25% probability on an Opteron!</p> <p>Starting RabbitMQ on just 2 nodes, I instantly gained nearly 30% improvement, using half the available processing power, and kernel time dropped to a far more normal 20-30% per core. I experimented with this for a few hours, and found that 3 nodes, with memory interleave across all 4 nodes, was the optimal configuration. But what of the Erlang scheduler?</p> <p>``` artemis:~$ erl Erlang R14B01 (erts-5.8.2) [source] [64-bit] [smp:24:24] [rq:24] [async-threads:0] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]</p> <p>Eshell V5.8.2 (abort with ^G) 1&gt; erlang:system_info(scheduler_bind_type). thread_no_node_processor_spread ```</p> <p>Erlang is smart enough to recognize that this is a NUMA system, but the scant documentation implies that the default scheduler type is best suited to to Hyper-Threading architectures. As it turns out though, all of the scheduler types that are documented as designed for NUMA were slower than the simple <code>processor_spread</code> scheduler, which out-performed the NUMA schedulers by almost 30%. And what of the number of schedulers and <a href="//stackoverflow.com/questions/1182025/what-do-the-erlang-emulator-info-statements-mean">request queues</a>? Though they're configured for 24 cores, experiments show that the default number of 24 is best, even given only 18 cores of execution. I can't speak to why exactly either of these two settings are best, but I can entertain any number of educated guesses.</p> <p>The last question that remained was, if we're to run with 3 out of 4 NUMA nodes, which ones do we choose? It seemed logical to pick the ones that weren't connected directly to the network card, the only other bit of hardware which we were trying to push as many bits through as possible.</p> <p>``` artemis:~$ lspci -tv -[0000:00]-+-00.0 ATI Technologies Inc RD890 Northbridge only dual slot (2x16) PCI-e GFX Hydra part +-04.0-[0000:04]–+-00.0 Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme II BCM5709 Gigabit Ethernet | -00.1 Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme II BCM5709 Gigabit Ethernet +-06.0-[0000:05]–+-00.0 Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme II BCM5709 Gigabit Ethernet | -00.1 Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme II BCM5709 Gigabit Ethernet ………………….</p> <p>artemis:~$ ifconfig eth1 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr aa:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa inet addr:111.111.111.111 Bcast:111.111.111.111 Mask:255.255.255.255 inet6 addr: ffff::ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff/64 Scope:Link UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1 RX packets:71583284 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0 TX packets:134508244 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 RX bytes:13852822249 (13.8 GB) TX bytes:23156900853 (23.1 GB) Interrupt:45 Memory:f4000000-f4012800</p> <p>artemis:~$ cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:04:00.1/irq 45</p> <p>artemis:~$ cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:04:00.1/numa_node 0 ```</p> <p>It's unclear how much of a difference that makes, but when RabbitMQ is under full load, a few of the cores on node 0 show 5-30% kernel usage, a mixture of network card and memory traffic.</p> <p>Our final configuration looks something like this. Your installation will have these stanzas in various places depending on the distribution and how your administrator configured the runtime scripts. Note that we turned off <a href="//www.erlang-solutions.com/thesis/tcp_optimisation/tcp_optimisation.html">async threads</a>. We didn't observe any benefit of enabling them, and it was unclear if they degraded performance.</p> <p><code> SERVER_ERL_ARGS="+K true +sbtps +P 10485760" exec setuidgid rabbitmq numactl --cpunodebind=!0 /usr/local/sbin/rabbitmq-server </code></p> <p>The final result? Using only 18 AMD cores of execution, artemis achieved 93% of the performance of leviathans 24 Intel cores. Given that Linux calculated a 22% performance difference, we'll call that a win. Who can complain about two hosts capable of 40,000 messages each vs. a single host capable of 43,000?</p> <p>What can we learn from this? Firstly, know the hardware you're buying. No matter how this played out, the Intel chips benchmarked faster, and we should have stuck with those when purchasing our RabbitMQ hosts. Second, the physical layout of the data path and the nature of your application together determine the bounds of your capacity. <em>Any</em> multithreaded application configured to use all of your cores, where the memory access pattern is not localized to a single thread, will exhibit <em>non-linear</em> performance inversely proportional to the number of NUMA nodes those threads run on.</p>
