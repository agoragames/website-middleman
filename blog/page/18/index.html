We've used it to build sites like <a href="http://tv.majorleaguegaming.com/">MLG.tv</a>. Last night I attended the NY Brightcove User's Group meeting and found out about their <a href="http://opensource.brightcove.com/">Brightcove Open Source portal</a>. So, I wrote to the good folks behind the Open Source @ Brightcove effort to get the brightcove-api gem added to their third party projects. They offered me door #2 and a chance to make it the officially "official" library for interacting with the Brightcove Media API from Ruby.</p> <p>And so here we are, the brightcove-api gem now lives alongside the other open source libraries for interacting with Brightcove. I'll still be the maintainer of the library and since it's open source, you can and always will be able to contribute to its continued development.</p> <p>You can find more hilarity over on my Twitter account, <a href="http://twitter.com/czarneckid">CzarneckiD</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jan 11 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/01/11/thumbs-up/">Thumbs Up</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>In the process of investigating the potential use of the <a href="https://github.com/brady8/thumbs_up">thumbs_up gem</a> (enable voting in your Rails 3 application) on a project today, I came across 2 opportunities to contribute back to the project.</p> <p>Those opportunities are now realities in that: I forked the project on GitHub, made my changes, and <a href="https://github.com/brady8/thumbs_up/pull/7">generated a pull request</a> for those changes to be integrated back into the thumbs_up project. So, what did I change?</p> <ul> <li> <p>My first commit was a simple change to the documentation clarifying the use of one method. No brainer right?</p> </li> <li> <p>My second commit was a bit more involved and wasn't necessarily a change I thought had to be there, but might be nice to be included. It involved getting into some of the internals in how the database migration and model file are generated. If this commit isn't integrated, I won't lose any sleep over it. It was a great opportunity to learn about some of the internals of <a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/generators.html">Rails 3 generators</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wycats/thor">Thor</a>. I'm not going to lie in that before all was said and done, I wanted to shoot myself into the sun on a rocketship, but I'm over it now.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Why am I writing this blog post? It just gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling (apart from the scotch), to know that I can contribute my day-to-day work back to the development community for others to benefit. So, thumbs up to that right?</p> <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> My changes (that now encompass the start of a test suite, have now been integrated into the thumbs_up gem.

Do you use <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a>? Do you use <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>? If you've answered yes to any or all of these questions, you might want to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard">leaderboard gem</a> I am releasing today.</p> <p>At Agora Games, one of the things we think a lot about is leaderboards. As they're a small, but important part of the work we do, I’m looking for ways to improve leaderboard generation for various situations. This effort was really the logical next step to my blog post, <a href="http://blog.agoragames.com/2011/01/01/creating-high-score-tables-leaderboards-using-redis/">Creating high score tables (leaderboards) using Redis</a>. All of the information you'd probably be interested in as a developer in terms of working with the gem can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard">leaderboard gem</a> page. Here's a quick rundown of some of the gem's capabilities:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Attach to a new or existing leaderboard</p> </li> <li> <p>Add and remove members from a leaderboard</p> </li> <li> <p>Return information about a leaderboard such as total members, total pages</p> </li> <li> <p>Return information about a member in the leaderboard such as their rank or score</p> </li> <li> <p>Update score information about a member in the leaderboard</p> </li> <li> <p>Retrieve the leaders from a leaderboard with ability to page within the leaderboard</p> </li> <li> <p>Retrieve the leaders around a given member in a leaderboard, also known as an "Around Me" leaderboard</p> </li> <li> <p>Retrieve information for an arbitrary list of members in a leaderboard, e.g. How do my friends compare against me?</p> </li> </ul> <p>I believe that this covers most of the interaction you might have with a leaderboard. But, if not, this code is open source, so feel free to contribute to its development.</p> <p>You can find more hilarity over on my Twitter account, <a href="http://twitter.com/czarneckid">CzarneckiD</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jan 2 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/01/02/creating-high-score-tables-leaderboards-using-redis-2/">Creating high score tables (leaderboards) using Redis</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>To my other colleagues at Agora Games, I have one word: FIRST!</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Now that I've got that out of my system, down to the business at hand.

I got a bug from our QA department that they wanted the CAPTCHA failure message to change from 'Captcha failed.' to 'CAPTCHA failed.'.</p> <p>I love that the Ruby and Rails community is so test-focused. I looked at the ruby-recaptcha issue tracker and there was already a patch for adding in customizable message support. However, with the patch, none of the tests passed. It was well within the library author's rights to give that patch the middle finger.</p> <p>So, what did I do? I applied the patch to my local copy of the ruby-repatcha library, fixed the tests, and <a href="http://bitbucket.org/mml/ruby-recaptcha/issue/2/make-the-error-message-customizable#comment-313094">submitted an updated patch</a>.</p> <p>Success.</p> <p>You can find more hilarity over on my Twitter account, <a href="http://twitter.com/czarneckid">CzarneckiD</a>.</p> <p><img alt="" title=happy-ruby src="http://static.rubyrags.com/pictures/1/ruby_makes_me_happy.png"/></p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Dec 9 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2010/12/09/hello-there/">Hello there...</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Steven Davidovitz</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>I'm Steven.

Included in it is a module called Deferrable that allows easy and lightweight concurrency. Deferrable makes it simple to spawn a blocking or long running operation, push it to the background, and on completion execute any number of code blocks (callbacks).</p> <p>Below, I've written a sample application that uses the Deferrable class and Eventmachine's event loop to parallelize HTTP API calls to <a title="whoismyrepresentative.com" href="http://whoismyrepresentative.com">whoismyrepresentative.com</a>.</p> <p>{% gist 734988 %}</p> <p>As each request is created it placed in a pool with all other requests which are then spawned and executed after a call to Request.run. As the GET calls come back they are checked for an error message and based upon that the appropriate callbacks attached at the creation of the request are called. In this case, if the call succeeds each representative for that zip code is printed out along with a phone number. If it fails, the error message is printed. As the output below shows, the calls are done completely in parallel and immediately after they return the callbacks are executed.</p> <p>{% gist 734989 %}</p> <p>As the number of requests increases, so does the performance benefit of using this model. Example timings for 25 requests done serially and in parallel are below.</p> <p>{% gist 735018 %}</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Dec 2 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2010/12/02/my-freedom-patch-gem-constant-redefinition/">My "Freedom Patch" Gem: constant-redefinition</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>The <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/constant-redefinition">constant-redefinition gem</a> allows you to define constants if not defined on an object and redefine constants without warning.</p> <p>Are you still with me? Good.</p> <p>The code "credit" for this gem comes from the Stack Overflow post, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3375360/how-to-redefine-a-ruby-constant-without-warning">"How to redefine a Ruby constant without warning?"</a>. It just so happens that I was working on a project today where our test suite was testing a large number of iterations to write out data. I wanted to redefine the number of iterations in test (based on a constant in the model) to respect the spirit of the test, but not do as many iterations in test. I googled, found that post, and it seemed like a neatly packageable item that would be useful to other developers.</p> <p>So, I created the <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/constant-redefinition">constant-redefinition gem</a>. You can also check out the <a href="https://github.com/czarneckid/constant-redefinition">GitHub constant-redefinition project</a>.

I'm a software developer, not a sharpshooter. So why don't more people version all of their gems in a Gemfile?</p> <p>Here is a sample Gemfile for a Rails 3 application I was looking at yesterday.</p> <p>{% gist 721842 %}</p> <p>The gems for Rails and thin have been versioned. Why aren't the gems for will_paginate, nokogiri, and haml versioned? I consider un-versioned gems moving targets. Why? You're going to get the latest version of a gem. The developer doesn't know (or necessarily care) you depend on XXX functionality in version 1.0.23 of their gem. And so what if in version 2.0.0 of their gem, they make incompatible changes that break your application? I consider versioned gems a virtual "stake in the ground". To the best of my abilities, with rigorous testing of course, I know that given these specific versions of gems, my application performs as expected.</p> <p>What's your opinion?</p> <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p> <p>Good point from my co-worker, Blake, who says that bundle will install the lastest version of a gem and then lock the version in your Gemfile.lock file on the first go-round. It could still be an issue if you do a "bundle update" locally or in your deployment process.</p> <p>You can find more hilarity over on my Twitter account, <a href="http://twitter.com/czarneckid">CzarneckiD</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-pagination> <ul class=inline-list> <li> <a href="/blog/page/19/">« Older entries </a></li> <li>Page 18 of 28</li> <li> <a href="/blog/page/17/">Newer entries » </a></li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class='columns large-3'> <div class=blog-archives-sidebar> <h2>Blog archives</h2> <h3> <a href="/blog/2015/">2015</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2015/03/">March 2015</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2015/01/">January 2015</a> </li> </ul> <h3> <a href="/blog/2014/">2014</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/12/">December 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/11/">November 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/10/">October 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/08/">August 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/07/">July 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/06/">June 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/04/">April 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/03/">March 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/02/">February 2014</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2014/01/">January 2014</a> </li> </ul> <h3> <a href="/blog/2013/">2013</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/11/">November 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/10/">October 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/09/">September 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/08/">August 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/07/">July 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/06/">June 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/05/">May 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/04/">April 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/03/">March 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/02/">February 2013</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2013/01/">January 2013</a> </li> </ul> <h3> <a href="/blog/2012/">2012</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/12/">December 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/11/">November 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/10/">October 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/09/">September 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/08/">August 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/07/">July 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/06/">June 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/05/">May 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/04/">April 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/03/">March 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/02/">February 2012</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2012/01/">January 2012</a> </li> </ul> <h3> <a href="/blog/2011/">2011</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/10/">October 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/09/">September 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/08/">August 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/07/">July 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/06/">June 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/05/">May 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/04/">April 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/03/">March 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/02/">February 2011</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2011/01/">January 2011</a> </li> </ul> <h3> <a href="/blog/2010/">2010</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/12/">December 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/11/">November 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/10/">October 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/09/">September 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/08/">August 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/07/">July 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/06/">June 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/05/">May 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/04/">April 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/03/">March 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/02/">February 2010</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2010/01/">January 2010</a> </li> </ul> <h3> <a href="/blog/2009/">2009</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/12/">December 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/11/">November 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/10/">October 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/09/">September 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/08/">August 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/07/">July 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/06/">June 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/05/">May 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/04/">April 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/03/">March 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/02/">February 2009</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2009/01/">January 2009</a> </li> </ul> <h3> <a href="/blog/2008/">2008</a> </h3> <ul> <li> <a href="/blog/2008/11/">November 2008</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2008/10/">October 2008</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2008/09/">September 2008</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/2008/08/">August 2008</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> <script src="/assets/javascripts/app-65d7c99d.js" async=true></script> </body> </html>
