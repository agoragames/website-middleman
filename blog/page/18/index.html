They can be agile, smart and effective, or they can be shallow and pedantic. They can be an hour-long laser-focused meeting on the points that matter, or a rambling mess of code reading to sleepy co-workers desperate for some cookies and a nap. I&rsquo;m on the team that builds backend services for the latest and greatest games; we take code reviews very seriously, and we look forward to them. So how do we go about it?</p> <p>We&rsquo;ve developed two schemes for official code reviews, and each one serves a unique purpose. The first approach grew organically and is informal, whereas the second is a relatively new scheme that we&rsquo;ve adopted and has already been very successful.</p> <p>Our older code reviews are somewhat similar to how many other teams conduct their reviews. A major new piece of code is written, and if on general consensus it is deemed &ldquo;important&rdquo;, each person on our team, or at least 2-3 of us, are responsible for giving it a thorough review, writing down their notes and attaching them to a <a href="http://lighthouseapp.com/">Lighthouse</a> ticket. We schedule a time for review, and then gather as a group and walk through each and every item of note, discussing as necessary. Usually the original developer leads the review, though one of the reviewers may also lead the discussion. We typically use this style of code review for new modules and services which are deployed in development or staging, to be entering production &ldquo;in the future&rdquo;. It is the first pass review, intended to bring many eyes to bear on immature code, where only one or two people may have been involved in implementation.</p> <p>We&rsquo;ve adopted a more formal practice for services and modules entering production. For any given title which is nearing production, we list all of the services it is using, including ones that may be very mature. For each service, we assign two reviewers and one change implementor, preferably none of the people who originally wrote the module, though in a small agile team this can be open to interpretation or convenience. The reviewers each perform a rigorous analysis, covering everything from code to configuration, interaction with other modules and services, algorithm efficiency, test suite coverage and whether the entire package conforms to the latest team practices. Our standards continue to evolve, and so even mature services benefit from this continual review process. A third person, the change implementor, then applies the recommended changes as well as anything else they see as needing improvement. The reviewers then review the changes, recommend additional fixes, pass back to the change implementor, and so on, until all 3 individuals agree that the service is ready for production. We make liberal use of <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> branches to track these changes. Near launch day, a fourth team member is responsible for confirming that the production deploy is operational; configurations comply with the final requirements, databases and other datastores are setup as designed, and <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">AMQP</a> hosts are operating as expected.</p> <p>In addition to these two formal schemes, we also use git and <a href="http://campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a> to continually review smaller changes. Each team member discusses their recent work in our daily standups and brings attention to code they think needs attention from others, and everyone takes part in reviewing changelists and recommending improvements as their schedules allow.</p> <p>We&rsquo;ve realized great benefit of these two approaches in combination. The former yields an informal but wide review of the code base, giving everyone an opportunity to understand the bleeding edge of our technology. Sometimes this includes learning an entirely new language or framework during the course of the review. The latter style yields a production-ready deliverable that has been approved by no fewer than 4 members of our team. In practice, the entire team has had a chance to either code a feature, review it, or implement changes, such that everyone can sign off that we are ready stand behind the coming tsunami of happy gamers playing the best new titles on the market. Both schemes allow individuals to thoroughly review the code at their own pace and according to their own schedules, so that group time is dedicated solely to discussing the items of importance. Everyone is involved in the success, proudly putting their signature on the final product even when their role in supporting a particular title may have been minor.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jan 14 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/01/14/brightcoveapi-newhome-brightcoveos/">Brightcove::API.new(:home => BrightcoveOS)</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>I am pleased to announce the <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveOS/Ruby-MAPI-Wrapper">brightcove-api gem</a> that I maintain has a new home at the <a href="http://opensource.brightcove.com/">Brightcove Open Source portal</a>.</p> <p>In June 2010, I wrote the brightcove-api gem to interact with the <a href="http://www.brightcove.com/en/">Brightcove</a> media APIs. We&rsquo;ve used it to build sites like <a href="http://tv.majorleaguegaming.com/">MLG.tv</a>. Last night I attended the NY Brightcove User&rsquo;s Group meeting and found out about their <a href="http://opensource.brightcove.com/">Brightcove Open Source portal</a>. So, I wrote to the good folks behind the Open Source @ Brightcove effort to get the brightcove-api gem added to their third party projects. They offered me door #2 and a chance to make it the officially &ldquo;official&rdquo; library for interacting with the Brightcove Media API from Ruby.</p> <p>And so here we are, the brightcove-api gem now lives alongside the other open source libraries for interacting with Brightcove. I&rsquo;ll still be the maintainer of the library and since it&rsquo;s open source, you can and always will be able to contribute to its continued development.</p> <p>You can find more hilarity over on my Twitter account, <a href="http://twitter.com/czarneckid">CzarneckiD</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Jan 11 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/01/11/thumbs-up/">Thumbs Up</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>In the process of investigating the potential use of the <a href="https://github.com/brady8/thumbs_up">thumbs_up gem</a> (enable voting in your Rails 3 application) on a project today, I came across 2 opportunities to contribute back to the project.</p> <p>Those opportunities are now realities in that: I forked the project on GitHub, made my changes, and <a href="https://github.com/brady8/thumbs_up/pull/7">generated a pull request</a> for those changes to be integrated back into the thumbs_up project. So, what did I change?</p> <ul> <li><p>My first commit was a simple change to the documentation clarifying the use of one method. No brainer right?</p></li> <li><p>My second commit was a bit more involved and wasn&rsquo;t necessarily a change I thought had to be there, but might be nice to be included. It involved getting into some of the internals in how the database migration and model file are generated. If this commit isn&rsquo;t integrated, I won&rsquo;t lose any sleep over it. It was a great opportunity to learn about some of the internals of <a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/generators.html">Rails 3 generators</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wycats/thor">Thor</a>. I&rsquo;m not going to lie in that before all was said and done, I wanted to shoot myself into the sun on a rocketship, but I&rsquo;m over it now.</p></li> </ul> <p>Why am I writing this blog post? It just gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling (apart from the scotch), to know that I can contribute my day-to-day work back to the development community for others to benefit. So, thumbs up to that right?</p> <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> My changes (that now encompass the start of a test suite, have now been integrated into the thumbs_up gem.

Do you use <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a>? Do you use <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>? If you&rsquo;ve answered yes to any or all of these questions, you might want to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard">leaderboard gem</a> I am releasing today.</p> <p>At Agora Games, one of the things we think a lot about is leaderboards. As they&rsquo;re a small, but important part of the work we do, I’m looking for ways to improve leaderboard generation for various situations. This effort was really the logical next step to my blog post, <a href="http://blog.agoragames.com/2011/01/01/creating-high-score-tables-leaderboards-using-redis/">Creating high score tables (leaderboards) using Redis</a>. All of the information you&rsquo;d probably be interested in as a developer in terms of working with the gem can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard">leaderboard gem</a> page. Here&rsquo;s a quick rundown of some of the gem&rsquo;s capabilities:</p> <ul> <li><p>Attach to a new or existing leaderboard</p></li> <li><p>Add and remove members from a leaderboard</p></li> <li><p>Return information about a leaderboard such as total members, total pages</p></li> <li><p>Return information about a member in the leaderboard such as their rank or score</p></li> <li><p>Update score information about a member in the leaderboard</p></li> <li><p>Retrieve the leaders from a leaderboard with ability to page within the leaderboard</p></li> <li><p>Retrieve the leaders around a given member in a leaderboard, also known as an &ldquo;Around Me&rdquo; leaderboard</p></li> <li><p>Retrieve information for an arbitrary list of members in a leaderboard, e.g. How do my friends compare against me?</p></li> </ul> <p>I believe that this covers most of the interaction you might have with a leaderboard.

I got a bug from our QA department that they wanted the CAPTCHA failure message to change from &lsquo;Captcha failed.&rsquo; to &lsquo;CAPTCHA failed.&rsquo;.</p> <p>I love that the Ruby and Rails community is so test-focused. I looked at the ruby-recaptcha issue tracker and there was already a patch for adding in customizable message support. However, with the patch, none of the tests passed. It was well within the library author&rsquo;s rights to give that patch the middle finger.</p> <p>So, what did I do? I applied the patch to my local copy of the ruby-repatcha library, fixed the tests, and <a href="http://bitbucket.org/mml/ruby-recaptcha/issue/2/make-the-error-message-customizable#comment-313094">submitted an updated patch</a>.</p> <p>Success.</p> <p>You can find more hilarity over on my Twitter account, <a href="http://twitter.com/czarneckid">CzarneckiD</a>.</p> <p><img title=happy-ruby src="http://static.rubyrags.com/pictures/1/ruby_makes_me_happy.png"/></p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Dec 9 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2010/12/09/hello-there/">Hello there...</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Steven Davidovitz</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>I&rsquo;m Steven.

Deferrable makes it simple to spawn a blocking or long running operation, push it to the background, and on completion execute any number of code blocks (callbacks).</p> <p>Below, I&rsquo;ve written a sample application that uses the Deferrable class and Eventmachine&rsquo;s event loop to parallelize HTTP API calls to <a title="whoismyrepresentative.com" href="http://whoismyrepresentative.com">whoismyrepresentative.com</a>.</p> <p>{% gist 734988 %}</p> <p>As each request is created it placed in a pool with all other requests which are then spawned and executed after a call to Request.run.

In this case, if the call succeeds each representative for that zip code is printed out along with a phone number. If it fails, the error message is printed. As the output below shows, the calls are done completely in parallel and immediately after they return the callbacks are executed.</p> <p>{% gist 734989 %}</p> <p>As the number of requests increases, so does the performance benefit of using this model.

It just so happens that I was working on a project today where our test suite was testing a large number of iterations to write out data. I wanted to redefine the number of iterations in test (based on a constant in the model) to respect the spirit of the test, but not do as many iterations in test. I googled, found that post, and it seemed like a neatly packageable item that would be useful to other developers.</p> <p>So, I created the <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/constant-redefinition">constant-redefinition gem</a>.
