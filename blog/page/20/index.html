Overall, I'd say the experience was awesome. I had a lot of fun on this co-op. Working at Agora was awesome for many reasons, the people are really friendly, the actual work is difficult and fun, and culture around this company makes working here awesome. I got to do so much here, and learn so much, even putting the programming knowledge aside I've learned so much.</p> </blockquote> <p>The people here are awesome. This needed to be repeated for great justice. Everyone here is very welcoming and friendly. They make an attempt to connect with you and help you whenever you're stuck. Everyone listens to what you say and then provides valuable feedback. I always felt like I could ask questions without hesitation. And whenever I did have a problem, I either had someone looking at my screen with me or explaining where I could go to find out more about my problem.</p> <p>The work here is awesome. For the majority of my co-op, I redesigned and developed the hydra dashboard from the ground up. This was no easy task and required a lot of work. This also included many upgrades from the original that required even more work. I love that I was responsible for such a huge task and that I had so much to work on. Several things had to happen for this be to be complete, a well designed user account system; a better visualization of talking to hydra/simplifying complex data inputs; and getting a new design/layout integrated with the current functionality to mention a few things. Each of these required a sufficient amount of planning, design, and work. And I got to become very skilled with recursion in solving these problems. I learned so much here at this co-op, that I was even inspired to make my own website with the skills I developed here. As a result of working here, I feel like I can solve pretty much any problem if I just learn about it.</p> <p>The culture here is awesome. I feel comfortable with everyone here, the environment is very relaxed. There's always amusing chat in campfire, we play video games, and we go to lunch for wings regularly. In all seriousness though, it's a very easy environment to settle into. Agora also has hackathons infrequently. These are days when you're part of a team and work for the whole day on one project as a team (come in at midnight if you want!). Even outside of work, you see people doing stuff. Whether it be at a local restaurant, or hosting barbecues, or playing halo on a friday night, it's a fun time working at Agora.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Nov 17 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2010/11/17/ssh-keys-agents-and-automation/">SSH keys, agents, and automation</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Armando DiCianno</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>The basis of automating tasks with ssh is setting up your ssh-agent to hold your unlocked keys. Basically, this means never having to type in a password more than once. If you frequently ssh into, run commands on, or copy files to a remote machine, typing in a passphrase over and over gets very tedious.</p> <p>This post explores integrating one or multiple ssh keys into a normal OS X user session. You'll learn how to create keys, and add them to your OS X Keychain, so you never need to type in your password, after log in, and still have a high level of security.</p> <p>The author Rita Mae Brow (or Albert Einstein, as the consensus is still out, it seems) was the first that said, "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results." This is a quote I was thinking about today, when I automated another task related to SSH that I commonly do manually: mounting a directory on a remote server over SSH on OS X.</p> <p>SSH is one of those protocols that has a very mature suite of tools around it. There are so many wonderful, easy things to do or change that make your workflow more efficient if you use SSH. SSH has first class support in GNU/Linux distributions and Mac OSX, and it can be configured readily into a streamlined workflow.</p> <p>I use OS X at work, and GNU/Linux on my home machines. This post represents the little bit of learning I had to do to make my nice, automated Linux setup work well on OS X at work. I'm going to go over the basics of ssh key management on OS X in this post, and follow up in another post with mounting a remote directory</p> <hr/> <p>First, you should already be using ssh to log into remote machines! Hopefully, you're already using ssh keys. If not, here's a quick example about how to setup your first key. The username on my machine is ' <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fafhrd_and_the_Gray_Mouser">fafhrd</a>', but you should replace that with your own username in the following examples. So, open up Terminal, and …</p> <p>{% gist 703566 %}</p> <p>Let's use ssh-add to check the keys in the agent. Note that for some commands, I use the full path. If you're running an install of ssh from <a href="//www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> or <a href="//www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/prefix/">Gentoo Prefix</a>, you may have to use the full path as well to get the built-in OS X version; this only matters for adding keys.</p> <p>{% gist 703572 %}</p> <p>Do you not see any return value? Let's add your key to the agent. In my case, I'm going to add a second key, as well. The following commands will add your keys to the ssh-agent daemon (background process). However, we also want to add the keys to the OS X keychain, so that they're automatically unlocked for you when you log in, so we add the -K flag. This flag does not exist on a stock openssh install, only on the ssh that ships with OS X. Without that flag, the key is only added to the currently running ssh-agent. Note that I'm adding both my keys, and you may just have one. (If your key is already in the keychain, there's no harm adding it again.)</p> <p>{% gist 703574 %}</p> <p>At this point, it's important to reboot. Alternatively, if you feel comfortable killing all instances of ssh-agent that are running, you may do so, log out, and log back in. After doing either, open Terminal again, and check for your keys.</p> <p>{% gist 703576 %}</p> <p>Great! keychain automatically unlocked the keys for you. Okay, it's time to try it out! If you haven't copied your public keys to your remote server, you should do so now. Your public key is most likely located at ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub (or id_rsa.pub). Please be sure to use the .pub file, and not the private key! You will want to append (and not necessarily replace) the public key into the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, on the remote side.</p> <p>{% gist 703577 %}</p> <p>… and test:</p> <p>{% gist 703582 %}</p> <p>Nice! The uname command ran on the remote server, and retuned it's data. You should not have been prompted for your password as the credentials are coming straight from your agent.</p> <p>So what have you actually accomplished? All commands that can use ssh, bundled with the ssh tools (e.g. scp, sftp) or otherwise (e.g. rsync, git, svn), will now never prompt you for your ssh passphrase. This should speed up your workflow, and allow your to automate more of your work. One caveat, though: make sure to lock your workstation when you leave your desk, if you're in an untrusted environment, as someone can open up Terminal, and log into your remote servers easily. However, for the flexibility this automation provides, it's a worthwhile tradeoff.</p> <p>Let's take this one step further. Want to type even less, by avoiding the "myname@" portion of the ssh command? Create or edit ~/.ssh/config to look like the following.</p> <p>{% gist 703627 %}</p> <p>… and now test without the "myname@" portion.</p> <p>{% gist 703634 %}</p> <p>The username piece, for any host that matches *.fake.com, automatically uses "myname". Wow, there's so much win right there, it brings a tear to my eye.</p> <p>In my next post, I'm going to go over mounting remount directories over ssh on OS X. Until then: have fun!</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Nov 16 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2010/11/16/coding-by-example/">Coding by Example</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>I don't think there's anything inherently wrong in coding by example, e.g. cutting and pasting code from a sample that works for you.

It has worked well up to this point. We recently had a requirement to send large messages through AMQP, this is where the driver failed us. The following are couple benchmarks and fix to get around the issue.</p> <p>```python »&gt; from amqplib import client_0_8 as amqp »&gt; import time</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>conn = amqp.connection.Connection() chan = conn.channel() msg = amqp.Message("1"*(1048576*100)) s = time.time(); chan.basic_publish(msg); print time.time() - s 54.5186219215 ```</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>Most of the 54 seconds above was being used in packing the message. This is caused by the following code:</p> <p>```python def write_method(self, channel, method_sig, args, content=None): payload = pack('&gt;HH', method_sig[0], method_sig[1]) + args</p> <p>self.dest.write_frame(1, channel, payload)</p> <p>if content: body = content.body payload = pack('&gt;HHQ', method_sig[0], 0, len(body)) + \ content._serialize_properties()</p> <p>self.dest.write_frame(2, channel, payload)</p> <p>while body: # HH', method_sig[0], method_sig[1]) + args</p> <pre><code>self.dest.write_frame(1, channel, payload)
</code></pre> <p>if content: body = content.body payload = pack('&gt;HHQ', method_sig[0], 0, len(body)) + \ content._serialize_properties()</p> <p>self.dest.write_frame(2, channel, payload)</p> <p>for payload in self._chunk_body(body, self.frame_max - 8): self.dest.write_frame(3, channel, payload) ```</p> <p>If we run the same test as above with the patched writer_method here is the result:</p> <p>```python »&gt; from amqplib import client_0_8 as amqp »&gt; import time</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>conn = amqp.connection.Connection() chan = conn.channel() msg = amqp.Message("1"*(1048576*100)) s = time.time(); chan.basic_publish(msg); print time.time() - s 0.23295211792 ```</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Oct 29 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2010/10/29/brightcove-gem-1-0-3/">Brightcove gem 1.0.3 </a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>I just pushed out version 1.0.3 of the <a href="//github.com/agoragames/brightcove">Brightcove gem</a>.

The ability to scale outward quickly in a time of need continuously aids our processes, encouraging rapid growth and timely response when load increases past the threshold of what our infrastructure can handle. As such, we tend to run most of our applications on scalable cloud providers.</p> <p>Recently, we decided to move one of our older sites to Rackspace Cloud, which is a relative newcomer to the cloud market who uses Xen for their hypervisor of choice. Here at Agora, we use an efficient application stack that consists of NGINX, which proxies back to haproxy, which in turn load balances to many FastCGI app servers on our backend in order to do the heavy PHP lifting in the most efficient way possible. We have been very happy with the results so far.</p> <p>After deploying this old site on these shiny new cloud hosts, everything appeared to work great. The site was faster than ever, we had brought all of the web server configs up to date (translated from Apache, which was used on the old hardware based servers), and tuned everything to be lightning quick. Finally, the celebrated day to flip the switch came…</p> <p>…and the site fell flat on its face within seconds.  All of the servers were idle, memory usage was minimal, there were no IO bottlenecks – we were stumped.</p> <p>Eventually, we took out an engineer's best friend – strace. Upon running stracing the php threads, we found that each site load was polling from <code>/dev/random</code>, which these days is about as far from a best practice as you can get. Examining the entropy pool, it turned out that it was continuously draining, and waiting to refill, and some old Crypt routines were to blame. We instructed php-mcrypt to use <code>/dev/urandom</code> by way of ﻿﻿﻿﻿<code>MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM</code>, and pushed the site live again. Suddenly, all servers went green. Success!</p> <p>To get down to it, the problem is with Xen and how it's virtual drivers work. Apparently, the virtual drivers do not add to the entropy pool for the system's random number generator, causing the pool to empty extremely quickly. The Xen team has known about this problem for a number of years, however it appears they have not fixed it. Using /dev/urandom, which one should always do anyway, eliminates this problem by providing a nonblocking source for random seeding. Yet more proof that going over old code and fixing bad practice can often prove beneficial. :)</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Oct 27 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2010/10/27/resque-and-resque-unit-in-rails-3/">Resque and Resque Unit in Rails 3</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>Do you need to create background jobs, place those jobs on multiple queues, and process them later? And do you want to test your queue appropriately? Are you using Rails 3?</p> <p>If your answer to those questions is yes, then you're probably already looking at and using <a href="//github.com/defunkt/resque">Resque</a> and <a href="//github.com/justinweiss/resque_unit">Resque Unit</a>. I really just want to cover the nice part about using these libraries in Rails 3. Let's cover the basic setup.</p> <p><code>Gemfile</code></p> <p>```ruby # Redis/resque</p> <p>gem 'resque', '1.8.2' gem 'redis', '2.0.12' gem 'redis-namespace', '0.10.0'</p> <p>group :test do gem 'factory_girl_rails', '1.0' gem 'mocha', '0.9.8' gem 'resque_unit', '0.2.6' end ```</p> <p><code>config/initializers/resque.rb</code></p> <p>```ruby require 'resque'</p> <p>redis_config = YAML.load_file("#{Rails.root}/config/redis.yml") Resque.redis = redis_config[Rails.env] Resque.redis.namespace = "resque:company:namespace" ```</p> <p><code>config/redis.yml</code></p> <p><code>ruby development: localhost:6379 test: localhost:6379 staging: localhost:6379 production: localhost:6379 </code></p> <p>Here's the kicker. As we're defining resque_unit in the "test" group in our Gemfile, it's going to "provide a mock Resque for testing Rails code that depends on Resque". Now we can make assertions in our tests about data in Resque without having to have Resque running. Pretty simple right?</p> <p>P.S. The answer to that last question is "yes".</p> <p>P.P.S. My code in the Gemfile does have indentation, the code formatter on our blog sucks.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Oct 25 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2010/10/25/amistad-friendships-in-rails-3/">Amistad: Friendships in Rails 3</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>If you're looking for a way to do friendships in Rails 3, you might have a look at <a href="//github.com/raw1z/amistad">Amistad</a>.

I wrote the code, tests, and updated documentation. I generated a pull request for my changes. The author of the library merged those changes into the master branch for Amistad.</p> <p>**So, how long should I keep my git fork around? **</p> <p>After writing this post, I'm going to remove the fork because the changes have been integrated into the master branch. I assume that's a reasonable thing to do as there's no divergence between my copy and master. And I don't want anyone to search for my branch, find it, use it, and then later have issues that a) need to be fixed or b) want to contribute more functionality. I want all of that to happen in the library's master branch.</p> <p>Is that reasonable? Or is there a period of time I should keep my fork around for? Am I overthinking this? I'd just like to know if there's a better workflow or standard that the community has adopted in this regard.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Oct 19 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2010/10/19/getting-cozy-with-shorthand-css-properties/">Getting Cozy with Shorthand CSS Properties</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Joshua Childs</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>I pride myself in being forgetful, but sometimes this can have unfortunate consequences. For instance, whenever I want to use the <a href="//www.devarticles.com/c/a/Web-Style-Sheets/CSS-shorthand-at-a-glance/3/">css background shorthand property</a> I simply can't remember the order.</p> <p>In case you aren't aware, the background shorthand basically allows you to specify a background all at once, that would otherwise need to be specified with multiple rules.</p> <p>For example</p> <p><code>css background-color: black background-attachment: fixed background-position: left top background-repeat: no-repeat background-image: url(example.gif) </code></p> <p>simply becomes</p> <p><code>css background: url(example.gif) no-repeat fixed left top black </code></p> <p>And the whole world is happy…</p> <p>As I mentioned the problem is I find it difficult to remember the order, and it seems that there is an order that should be followed, if for no reason other than consistency. As a result I always find myself turning to Google to remember what that order is. This is frustrating, but even more frustrating Google never returns the result I'm looking for and I end up leafing through several results to eventually stumble upon a code example that can help me.</p> <p>Well, not anymore! Turns out there is an easier way then this and one which doesn't require me to resort to hardcore memorization (my only weakness). As anyone who really knows me is already aware, I love <a href="//getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>. The reasons go on and on, but now I have a new one. Firebug automatically fixes the background style rule providing the complete and proper format. If you specify a background rule and just give it say a color, or take your best shot at specifying all the properties you need then leave the style pane for a second or two and close your eyes, by the time you come back Firebug would have parsed and updated your best effort with the correct format. How nice.</p> <p>Once I realized this, I couldn't help but share my excitement with some of the fellows around the office. Well, our new teammate Nick pointed out that it would be cool if this worked for the font shorthand as well; I thought so too. As it turns out however, it does not. That's really too bad, but maybe we will see this feature come along in the future. I think it would be a welcomed addition all around to an already spectacular tool.
