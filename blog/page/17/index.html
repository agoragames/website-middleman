Clarke Foley, Production Coordinator, and Devon Smith, QA Team Lead, represented Agora amongst a who&rsquo;s-who of Tech Valley companies. Nicholas Ruepp, Producer at Vicarious Visions (VV), spoke about how the successful game studio adapted to the Agile Development process during the production of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 in 2007.</p> <p>At this time, VV implemented 3-week sprints, burndown charts, and retrospectives, along with cork boards as a project-tracking tool. The &ldquo;Big Wins&rdquo; that were realized with the Scrum/Agile processes included seeing a steady level of effort from developers throughout a project life cycle, rather than the typical waterfall process and it&rsquo;s subsequent employee burnout.  Also, the new iterative planning allowed day-to-day developer overhead to be very low, and the entire company shifted its culture to a more cross-discipline mentality.</p> <p>Bill Hoffman, VP and CTO of Kitware Inc. began his presentation with a very poignant fact; “the use of Agile is intended to remove waste from the development system”. There are seven common inefficiencies that many game and software development companies face. These include partially done work, extra features, relearning, hand-offs, task switching, delays, and defects. Through Kitware&rsquo;s adaptation of the Agile process, they have been able to reduce inefficiencies in their workflow. Hoffman&rsquo;s token Agile ideology is the differing of feature commitment as long as possible. Doing this allows for flexibility while keeping options open as long as possible. According to Hoffman, having high-speed production must be enabled by inherent quality standards; the job of testing is to prevent defects not to find them.</p> <p>Hoffman mentioned that Kitware uses Mantis Issue Tracker, Visual Tool Kit, and Python scripts to create burndown charts. While the tools don&rsquo;t always make the mechanic, it is interesting to see which is preferred. At Agora, Pivotal Tracker and Lighthouse are the primary Agile Project Management tool and bug trackers. New testing tools for support of iterative software development include Cucumber, Rspec, and Litmus along with Siege for load testing. Overall, we look forward to the next Tech Valley event. We hope to hearing about other Capital Region technology firms and how they are increasing their production and profitability with the Agile Development process.</p> <p> </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> May 19 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/05/19/the-haigha-preview/">The Haigha Preview</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>Agora has released a preview of Haigha, its new Python client for Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). AMQP is a standardized application protocol for messaging middleware. Its purpose is to govern the behavior of the messaging provider and receiver to facilitate interoperability between vendors.</p> <p>Haigha is a descendant of py-amqplib, a common library used by the Python community. Haigha has been built from the ground up to use libevent for high performance IO while presenting a simple API that adheres to the form and function of the AMQP specification. It adds several useful features that simplify access to powerful AMQP idioms. By default, Haigha operates in a completely asynchronous mode, using callback-passing to trigger application code in response to AMQP events.</p> <p>For more information and installation, visit: <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/haigha"> https://github.com/agoragames/haigha</a></p> <p> </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Apr 29 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/04/29/speed-up-testing-with-spork/">Speed Up Testing With Spork</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>If you TATFT, embrace red-green-refactor, or you just want to speed up execution of your test suite, you might want to take a look at <a href="https://github.com/timcharper/spork">Spork</a>.

Its feature set gives us complete freedom to iterate with developers during game production, its performance is sufficient to power our infrastructure during peak load, our operations team appreciate its powerful administration tools, and 10gen has so far proven itself a reliable technology partner and steward of the Mongo roadmap. One of the very important features of PyMongo that we have made use of is the MasterSlaveConnection, but it&rsquo;s not without its caveats, one of those being that it does not guarantee you are balancing your reads across a replica set.</p> <p>Before we dig in, a few items of note. First, the situation I&rsquo;m covering here is specifically when you&rsquo;re connecting directly to a <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Replica+Sets">replica set</a>. There may be a similar pattern to follow on a sharded database, but that&rsquo;s outside the scope of this post and what our team is working with. Secondly, if you&rsquo;re not familiar with the <a href="http://api.mongodb.org/python/1.9%2B/api/pymongo/master_slave_connection.html">MasterSlaveConnection</a>, the gist of the class is that it directs all writes to the current master, and randomly choses a slave for each read-only query. Lastly, we have some pending <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver/pull/24">patches</a> to pymongo 1.9 that I recommend applying before you begin, as they&rsquo;ll affect your ability to use the MasterSlaveConnection and seamlessly restart or shutdown hosts in your replica set.</p> <p>The situation we&rsquo;re correcting for here is where we have a replica set, with one or more slaves, and we want to maintain balanced reads across them. Our application is long running, and at any time the operations team may remove a host from the replica set to perform maintenance. Mongo and pymongo will work together to ensure high availability failover, but once you&rsquo;ve brought your replica set back to full capacity, your application will not connect to that host unless there&rsquo;s another socket disconnect, and even then not guarantee it will connect to the original host. You&rsquo;ve now lost a substantial amount of performance and scalability until your application has restarted.</p> <p>{% gist 858617 %}</p> <p>Read through connection() to understand the basics of instantiating a MasterSlaveConnection, or in this case our subclass ClusterConnection. It is initialized with a single Connection to the master, and then for each host in our list, we create a slave Connection. The Connection class is smart in that it can maintain a list of hosts, both configured and discovered from the replica set, and connect to any one of them at any time. The master Connection will always connect to the current master out of our list of hosts and handle when the master changes. The slave connections are configured with slave_okay=True so that they&rsquo;ll stay connected to whichever host we tell them and failover to other slaves, and _connect=False is passed so that if a slave is not currently available, Connection and MasterSlaveConnection can kindly follow their AutoReconnect paths without interrupting your application. So long as you have just the master up, you&rsquo;ll never know that the replica set may be impaired at the time you initialize the connection.</p> <p>The class ApplicationDatabaseInterface is simply an example of whatever you use to maintain an interface to the database within your application. The only requirement here is that we have some ability to cache an existing MasterSlaveConnection and call validate_slaves() on it before we use it. I recommend validating the slaves only once per application &ldquo;transaction&rdquo;, however that may apply to your use case (see query() in the example above).</p> <p>The validate_slaves() method is really where the important work is done. This example implementation will check for us every 5 minutes, but your criteria and interval can be whatever suites your needs. First it uses the same code as pymongo to parse the slave URIs so you can support host and port schemes. It walks through all of the slaves and if the current host and port of a Connection are not in the list of configured hosts, closes that connection and removes it from the slave list. If there are any hosts in our list of slaves which do not have a connection, it then re-populates the slave list with a fresh Connection for that host. The new connection also includes the _connect=False flag, so we&rsquo;ll never get an AutoReconnect exception in case a slave is not available at the time this code is run.</p> <p>The reason we remove connections from the slave list is because the Connection class doesn&rsquo;t maintain its internal list of possible hosts in any <a href="http://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PYTHON-218">priority</a>. If we simply closed the connection it will reconnect, but we aren&rsquo;t guaranteed that it will reconnect to its originally-configured host, and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re trying to ensure.</p> <p>The last important bit of this is the with_reconnect decorator. It&rsquo;s not strictly required, but for completeness, you should have something like this in your stack when communicating with Mongo. In addition to connection drops, there are situations such as <a href="http://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PYTHON-216">this</a> where the driver will raise an AutoReconnect because the replica set is in transition. I&rsquo;ve found that 2 seconds is about the maximum amount of time it takes for pymongo and the replica set to agree that all is well with the world, so this example decorator gives enough time for that situation to resolve itself.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Mar 2 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/03/02/chai-the-simple-python-mock/">Chai, the simple Python mock</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>Here at Agora we take testing seriously, insisting that full test coverage always be part of a deliverable and adjusting our schedules accordingly.

Most recently, some have called me a “successful entrepreneur.” I am introduced to people as the CEO of a “successful business,” or prompted to tell classes of my “success story.” But what is success?</p> <p>Success can mean many things to different people. I like to use the phrase “depending on your definition of success” when talking to people looking to start a business, because that definition changes everything.</p> <p>For some it might be to create a billion dollar company. For others it may mean working happily with a handful or coworkers. Success is a multi-dimensional factor, and can be based on financial, personal, product, or legacy criteria (among others).</p> <p>If you want to start a business, first figure out your measure of success. What are you trying to accomplish? Is it all about the people, the product, or just making money? What motivates you and what goal are you striving towards?</p> <p>At Agora, I’ve defined success as many things. It’s doing high quality work that I’m proud of. It’s creating and maintaining a reputation as an awesome company to work for. It’s being profitable, so I can keep doing what I love.</p> <p>To me, success is not about being a certain size, reaching certain revenue numbers, or doing a certain number of sales in a year. These are all a means to an end. For me – for Agora – success is having a job like no other; if I manage to create an incredible place to work, staffed with incredible people, doing incredible work, I am successful.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Feb 17 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2011/02/17/the-path-of-iteration-in-business/">The Path of Iteration in Business</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Mike DelPrete</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>Entrepreneurs often ask me what the biggest factor was in our success. They want to know exactly what we did and how we did it so that they can duplicate that success. The truth is that there isn’t one thing, and there never is. You can never attribute the success of a multi-year, multi-person venture down to exactly one thing. However, there <em>are</em> factors that can help.</p> <p>The advice I give to entrepreneurs is simple: just keep trying. Succeeding with a business is a result of hard work and constantly trying new things. Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket and hope it works out. Try something, get it out there, and repeat.</p> <p>Many entrepreneurs are stuck on the notion of a “master plan.” They think of a huge idea with huge potential returns, huge risk, and a huge cost. In reality, no one can perfectly plan where the business will take you.</p> <p>Instead of executing on a plan with a high risk and high reward, I encourage entrepreneurs to take baby steps. Interested in a particular market? What’s the quickest, simplest project you could do to take you there? Have a product idea? What’s the easiest and quickest way to develop a prototype? How can you get something out in a month instead of a year?</p> <p>While not the single key to our success, adaptability has been a huge part of it. Take an idea, try it out, and learn from it. Instead of plotting out a 12-month plan to launch your business, focus instead of taking smaller steps in the general direction you want to go.
