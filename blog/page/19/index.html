I wanted to follow up with a much more concise script that accomplishes the same ends through different means. Using this script requires no changes to how you start the development server and, even cooler perhaps, allows you to start the rails 2 server as if you were in a rails 3 project. Shout out goes to Intern Mike for the assist.</p> <p>{% gist 722473 %}</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Nov 29 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2010/11/29/moving-to-rails-3-pain-point-rails-server/">Moving to Rails 3 Pain Point: rails server</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>I have posted a <a href="//blog.agoragames.com/2010/11/30/a-better-way-to-avoid-a-project-named-server/">better solution</a>!</em></p> <p>Working with rails 2 and 3 projects back and forth, day to day has been pretty painless thanks to <a href="//rvm.beginrescueend.com/">rvm</a> and <a href="//rvm.beginrescueend.com/workflow/rvmrc/">.rvmrc files</a>. That is with the exception of accidentally running <code>rails server</code> on a rails 2 project. I do this all the time and it results in generating a new rails project called server rather then starting the rails server, my actual intention. It's almost as frustrating when running <code>script/server</code> on a rails 3 project but at least it doesn't spit out a bunch of useless files. Incidentally, all of the built in rails command (i.e. generate, console, …) set the same trap. To avoid falling prey, I have created a bunch of shell functions which I would like to share with everyone in case they would like to be privy as well.</p> <p>The shell code is included in the gist below. I load these functions into my .bashrc file (actually my .zshrc file). Once they are are available just get in the habit of running <code>rails-server</code> or <code>rails-generate</code> or <code>rails-whatever</code> and the correct command will always be issued. Also, if anyone knows a better solution, do share!</p> <p>As one final note, I run <code>rails-server</code> so often that I have is aliased to <code>s</code> . If you would like to do the same add <code>alias s=rails-server</code> to your .bashrc file.</p> <p>{% gist 720619 %}</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Nov 24 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2010/11/24/interactive-git-stash-for-stashing-single-or-multiple-files/">Interactive Git Stash For Stashing Single or Multiple Files</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> git stash save –patch</p> <p>From the git docs, "With –patch, you can interactively select hunks from in the diff between HEAD and the working tree to be stashed."</p> <p>This past week, I came across a situation where I wanted to stash a couple of working files in a git repository, pull in some changes, and then apply the stash. However, I couldn't immediately see the forest for the trees or some other stupid metaphor. Basically it was just a case where I had to RTFM for git stash.

It was a interesting experience to be on the flip side of the job search process for a change, sitting at our table answering questions, taking resumes, and evaluating applicants' skills to see if they might be the right fit for our team.</p> <p>One question that was asked repeatedly by fair-goers over the course of the two events was, 'What skills do I need, or what courses should I take, to be the best candidate to work at your company?'. This was a tough question to answer.</p> <p>The best answer that I could give was, 'There is no predefined skill-set. Today we are looking for Ruby on Rails developers, but tomorrow that may change. In a few months we may be looking for C++ or PHP or Flash devs depending on what we need at the time, so there's no real way to say.'</p> <p>To hear that probably sounds like a kick in the pants, like there's no way to prepare yourself, but the truth is that the software industry changes so fast that there really isn't any way to predict what technologies will be in style or what skills will be in demand tomorrow. However, there are things you can do to distinguish yourself from other candidates despite this ugly truth. I offered the following prescription:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Release code. Find or start a project that you're excited about and contribute. It doesn't matter what language or framework, but just get something out there. The best candidates that we found were the ones that showed initiative and put forth extra effort in some little hobby project that they posted on sites like github.</p> </li> <li> <p>Get involved. Pick a conference or local user group on some topic that interests you and go! Conferences such as RailsConf, RubyConf, Game Developers Conference (GDC ), and even Penny Arcade Expo (PAX) offer great opportunities to meet and interact with like-minded developers. What could be more fun than hacking on a project together with your new friends? Maybe some of that code could even be released back into the community, or used as samples to show a future employer… hmm…</p> </li> </ol> <p>In the end, the answer is to do what you love. If your goal is to code, then so do. Get involved and code. The code you produce, experience you gain, and connections you forge will have a beneficial side-effect of making you stand out in any future job search despite any new trend.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Nov 22 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2010/11/22/going-all-the-way-with-factory_girl-and-rails3-generators/">Going All The Way With factory_girl and rails3-generators</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>I responded to a few tweets from <a href="//twitter.com/barrettclark">Barrett Clark</a> about <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl">factory_girl</a> noting that you can get a lot more functionality out of factory_girl than just replacing fixtures.

Now let us add a scaffold for a person with first_name and last_name attributes.</p> <p>{% gist 710417 %}</p> <p>BOOM!

Thoughts of a standard semantic design pattern, an unordered list (UL) with list items (LI) floated to one side, possibly with delimited items to help visually separate each link.</p> <p>This design pattern generally produces markup that looks something like:</p> <p>{% gist 704052 %}</p> <p>And styling like: {% gist 704057 %}</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>This doesn't look so bad, but there's a problem. Those pipes (</td> <td>) don't belong in the markup. Because they don't describe any piece of the document, and they are not content, they are purely presentational. As such, they belong in the presentation layer (stylesheets).</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>For a some time now, front-end developers have had to settle for mixing content and presentation in order to maintain a single experience across browsers and platforms due to inconsistent implementations of css2.</p> <p>Today, notions of one user experience for a website have been shattered by paradigm shifts such as increased market penatration of mobile browsing devices. This shift combined with improved client support for css2 and css3 modules, as seen in IE9pr3, has given us the freedom to build similar but different experiences for users. We are free to build on strengths of each browser while accepting that some browsers may not fully support the presentational features desired.</p> <p>With that in mind:</p> <p>{% gist 704060 %}</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Our navigation markup now looks the way it should, meaning it's a list of links in no particular order, with only relevant content. There are no pipes (</td> <td>) or other delimiters meant only for presentation purposes. The wrapping DIV element has been substituted with a NAV element to be more descriptive.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>The following CSS does the same basic styling as the first, but notice the last two rules. {% gist 704064 %}</p> <p>The last two rules are how we're able to put those delimiters in the presentation layer. Let's take a closer look. {% gist 704067 %}</p> <p>This rule is adding the pipe (|) delimiter to all of the list (LI) element that have nav.site-nav as their ancestor. {% gist 704069 %}</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>And here we look up the last list item (LI) of our unordered list (UL) and remove the pipe delimiter (</td> <td>) we added with the previous rule.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Some of you may be saying that this won't work in all browsers (&lt; IE9pr3, &lt; FF3, &lt; Safari4, ect). This is true, it won't work in all browsers, but when you're thinking about doing something like this, ask yourself, "Do I need this for users to be able to use my site?" If yes, then by all means put those load bearing delimiters in your markup. If no, enjoy the knowledge that you can have a more semantic html document, a stylesheet file that takes advantage of modern implementations of css, and a flexible user experience that degrades gracefully in older browsers. Make the move to more cleanly separated content and presentation layers.</p> <p>You can find more of my musings on the Twitters,  <a href="//twitter.com/JoshuaChilds">@JoshuaChilds</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Nov 19 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2010/11/19/ssh-on-os-x-mounting-a-remote-directory-easily/">SSH on OS X: mounting a remote directory easily</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Armando DiCianno</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>There are many things you can do quickly, and easily, once you have your ssh keys automatically added to your keychain on OSX. One of the more fun things is using MacFUSE to allow you to automatically mount a directory on a remote machine, as if it was a remote share in Finder. This post will show you how.</p> <p><strong>CAVEAT</strong>: before attempting the steps in this post, please reference <a href="//blog.agoragames.com/2010/11/17/ssh-keys-agents-and-automation/">my last post</a> about how to setup your ssh keys on OS X.</p> <hr/> <p>First, dowload and install <a href="//code.google.com/p/macfuse/">MacFuse</a> if you don't have it yet. You may have it if you've installed 3rd party products like VMware. A good place to check is System Preferences — if you see a control panel for it, click on it, and if it's above version 2.0, then you're good to go. You can download MacFUSE <a href="//code.google.com/p/macfuse/downloads/list">here</a>, if you don't have it yet.</p> <p>For the rest of this document, I've generally followed the instructions laid out <a href="//code.google.com/p/macfuse/wiki/MACFUSE_FS_SSHFS">here</a>, which you may want to referenced.</p> <p>Run the following sequence of commands in Terminal. Note that you can change the location of "MYDIR", to a spot you prefer. You will need Subversion (svn) installed. The installation of svn is beyond the scope of this post, but consider installing it via <a href="//www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>. <strong>UPDATE</strong>: It was pointed out to me that subversion actually ships with OS X, at /usr/bin/svn, so you probably have it installed already.</p> <p>{% gist 705731 %}</p> <p>That was pretty straightforward. Now you're ready to test mounting the remote directory. You're going to need a remote server that you can already ssh into. I use the Bash variables VOLNAME and SRVNAME as the name of the folder I want to create locally, and the remote server name, respectively. You'll need to edit these to your liking and needs.</p> <p>{% gist 705741 %}</p> <p>Awesomesauce, looks like everything worked. Now, let's automate things a bit, and make a little GUI app that you can click on to mount the share in AppleScript. I've not made this AppleScript too advanced, so make sure to use the fully expanded commands from above. Open "AppleScript Editor", and enter the following code.</p> <p>{% gist 705745 %}</p> <p>After you've entered that code into "AppleScript Editor", you're going to want to save it twice. - Save As -&gt; File Format: Script , for reference. - Save As -&gt; File Formar: Applicaiton (to run)</p> <p>Save the application version to somewhere handy for you, such as your Desktop.</p> <p>For extra bonus points, here's what I do: - Find a small image, via screen shot, or otherwise, and save it to your Desktop. - Open the image in Preview, Select All, and Copy. - Context-click on your AppleScript-saved-as-Application, and select "Get Info" - Click once on the small icon at the top of the pane that opens. - Paste. … and <em>voilà!</em>, you have a handy, easily referencable application-type icon, that you can click on to mount your remote share.
