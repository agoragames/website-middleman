The library is a semantic wrapper around Redis sorted sets to store and interact with the leaderboard data. When I first released the library, I had put a section in the README on <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard#performance-metrics">Performance Metrics</a>. This provided a useful benchmark from which to gauge performance regressions that might be introduced when adding new functionality.</p> <p>I re-ran the benchmarks on my MacBook Pro, 2.5 GHz Intel Core i7, 8 GB 1333 MHz DDR3, Mountain Lion 10.8.2, Ruby 1.9.3-p327, Redis 2.6.7, redis gem 3.0.2, Redis persistence disabled.</p> <p>By default, the code will <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard/blob/master/lib/leaderboard.rb#L108-L128">use a Redis transaction to rank a member</a> in the leaderboard. This is to accommodate being able to optionally store data alongside the leaderboard. However, in hindsight, the common case may just be ranking (or updating) a  member in the leaderboard without this data.</p> <p>Time to insert 10 million records w/ Redis transactions per insert: <strong>23 minutes</strong></p> <p>It seems like Redis transactions, where they&rsquo;re really not needed, is having a performance impact. I removed the transaction parts of the rank_member method in the library temporarily and re-ran the benchmark code.</p> <p>Time to insert 10 million records w/o Redis transactions per insert: <strong>13 minutes</strong></p> <p>This number makes more sense to me and is inline with the original benchmark time of 15 minutes accounting for faster hardware, updated Redis version and updated Redis client library. Awhile back, however, I specifically added a few methods to do <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard/blob/master/lib/leaderboard.rb#L221-L242">bulk insert of member data in a leaderboard</a>. I modified and re-ran the benchmark code to rank members in the leaderboard, 1 million per transaction.</p> <p>Time to insert 10 million records w/ Redis transaction inserting 1 million records at a time: <strong>7 minutes</strong></p> <p>When I initially re-ran the benchmark against the leaderboard 3.0.0 code, it felt slower, but I needed actual numbers to backup that feeling. Now I can benchmark the code again if I decide to add in a conditional to not use a Redis transaction in the rank_member method if optional data is not supplied.</p> <p> </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Nov 30 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2012/11/30/game-face-39/">Game Face</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games.

The coolest of the cool.</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>Steven Flenory</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>Here at  <a href="http://www.agoragames.com/">Agora Games</a>, we try to do semi-regular Hack-a-thons in the office. Over the last year, we&rsquo;ve started trying to do them about once every 2-3 months. This seems to keep them fresh and fun, but still something that doesn&rsquo;t interfere with day to day work needs.</p> <p>Hackathons have been around since the late 90s, so they&rsquo;ve been around for awhile  in the tech field. The idea of a hackathon, as it pertains to Agora, is to give our employees 24 hours to work on anything they want as long as it relates to our business in some way.</p> <p>Our most recent hackathon took place this past week Thursday 8th - Friday 9th. It started at 4pm on Thursday with a nice kick-off meeting where everyone announced their projects or joined a team as a free agent (if they didn&rsquo;t have their own project).  Everything ended on Friday at 4pm with the demo session. There were a lot of cool projects, but I wanted to point out some of the way cool ones that were showcased.</p> <p><strong>Gamebattles Match History -  <a href="https://twitter.com/KrussB">Kirk Becker</a></strong></p> <p>A portion of Agora developers make up the tech arm of Major League Gaming, and a couple of people worked on MLG specific projects. One of these projects focused on adding in a page that displays a user&rsquo;s individual Match History.</p> <p>This is something that the users of MLG have been asking for, and since we like to please, Kirk is just about ready to release this to the world. In 24 hours, Kirk was able to get a working version of this up on our staging environment. Since this is such a cool product, work will be completed on this in the next couple days, and the users will love it.</p> <p><img width=272 height=300 src="/assets/images/uploads/2012/11/Screen-Shot-2012-11-14-at-2.42.51-PM-272x300-11105a77.png"/></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Podium - <a href="https://twitter.com/CzarneckiD">David Czarnecki</a></strong></p> <p>David wanted to take this hackathon to explore the use of ProMotion and Formation iOS libraries for application development. Working with these two libraries, He wanted to move to a higher level from hand-writing the interactions in iOS development.</p> <p>The work done by David is available for review in the following links below. Please note that the iOS coponent requires RubyMotion</p> <p>Podium API -  <a href="https://github.com/czarneckid/podium-api">https://github.com/czarneckid/podium-api</a> Podium iOS -  <a href="https://github.com/czarneckid/podium-ios">https://github.com/czarneckid/podium-ios</a></p> <p><a href="https://github.com/clayallsopp/formotion">https://github.com/clayallsopp/formotion</a> <a href="https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion">https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion</a></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Seraph - Brennan Frydl</strong></p> <p>Brennan made a mini web framework in the spirit of Rails, but running on em-synchrony. This uses tilt for templates, rack-mounts parser for routing, and doesn&rsquo;t make any assumptions about the data/ORM layer! Much like node.js, it handles situations where requests need significant amounts of time. Rather than using CPU, it&rsquo;ll make calls to external web services.</p> <p>Basic configuration was complete within the 24 hour timeframe, and a nice demo was given which showed the performance improvements when compared to Rails. After looking at the product for another day, it appears as though this is going to be re-written and possibly used in the future here at Agora! Nice!</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/bfrydl/seraph">Check it out here </a></p> <p><strong>Notification Bar - <a href="https://twitter.com/jlet">Jack Letourneau</a></strong></p> <p>Jack created a basic UI for defining time-based notifications using a zoomable/scrollable timeline widget and a WYSIWYG content editor. There was also the creation of a jQuery based widget for popping up notifications onto the top edge of the browser window.</p> <p>This is something that we&rsquo;ve been thinking about doing for our Hydra mobile product, so it was awesome that this was something that got worked on during a hackathon. Development for this item has also continued since the hackathon, which is a beautiful thing.</p> <p>In all, this was a really successful hackathon for Agora Games. A couple of the projects that were worked on by our engineers are actually going to be utilized in future products across both Major League Gaming and Agora Games. I call that a success!</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=blog-entry> <div class=blog__date> Nov 9 </div> <div class=blog__contents> <h2 class=blog__title> <a href="/blog/2012/11/09/game-face-36/">Game Face</a> </h2> <div class=blog__author> By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong> </div> <div class=blog__body> <p>“Game Face” will be our weekly round-up of our internal and external open source work here at Agora Games.

The 0.1.0 release integrates the beta-refactor branch. All types of timeseries are created with the Timeseries constructor. The arguments to the constructor have been changed to simplify and clarify their usage. In particular, a single timeseries implements only a single type (e.g. Histogram), read and write functions are shared by all intervals in a timeseries, and the count_only support is now the timeseries type <code>count</code>. Added exceptions. Only exception currently implemented is UnknownInterval.</p> <p>Contributor(s): Aaron Westendorf (<a href="https://github.com/awestendorf/">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/WashUffize">Twitter</a>)</p> <p><strong>leaderboard</strong></p> <p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard/">leaderboard</a> allows you to build leaderboards using Redis.
