<p><strong>leaderboard-coffeescript</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-coffeescript">leaderboard-coffeescript</a> is our leaderboard project, originally written in Ruby, ported to CoffeeScript. Both this version and the <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-python">leaderboard-python</a> port have 100% feature parity with the <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard">original Ruby library</a>. We will do a formal 1.0.0 release of this library once we work out what to do with respect to naming since there is an existing leaderboard library available from the Node Package Manager.</p>

<p><strong>leaderboard</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard/">leaderboard</a> allows you to build leaderboards using Redis. We released version 3.0.0 this week which incorporates the following changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Added rank_member_if and rank_member_if_in methods that allow you to rank a member in the leaderboard based on execution of a lambda.</li>
  <li>
    <p>No longer cast scores to a floating point automatically. If requesting a score for an unknown member in the leaderboard, return <code>nil</code> . Under the old behavior, a <code>nil</code> score gets returned as 0.0. This is misleading as 0.0 is a valid score.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Removes <code>:use_zero_index_for_rank_option</code> as valid option for requesting data from the leaderboard. <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard/pull/27">Original proposal</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optional member data is stored in a single hash. <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard/pull/26">Original proposal</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adds <code>:sort_by</code> as valid option for requesting data from the leaderboard. <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard/pull/30">Original proposal</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>Removes <code>:with_scores</code> and <code>:with_ranks</code> as valid options for requesting data from the leaderboard</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<p>A version jump to 3.0.0 was required since the storage of optional member data for a leaderboard was backwards incompatible with the 2.x release.</p>

<p><strong>leaderboard-python</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-python">leaderboard-python</a> is our leaderboard project, originally written in Ruby, ported to Python. We released version 2.2.0 this week, which has functional parity with the Ruby library. You would be able to use either library to interact with leaderboard data in Redis. Going forward, we will try as best we can to always maintain functional parity between the Ruby and Python implementations.</p>

</div></div></div><div class="blog-entry"><div class="date-comments"><div class="date">Dec 3</div></div><div class="blog-content"><h2><a href="/blog/2012/12/03/benchmarking-redis-transactions/">Benchmarking Redis Transactions</a></h2><div class="blog-author">By <strong>David Czarnecki</strong></div><div class="blog-body"><p>I recently released version 3.0.0 of our <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard">leaderboard</a> library. The library is a semantic wrapper around Redis sorted sets to store and interact with the leaderboard data. When I first released the library, I had put a section in the README on <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard#performance-metrics">Performance Metrics</a>. This provided a useful benchmark from which to gauge performance regressions that might be introduced when adding new functionality.</p>

<p>I re-ran the benchmarks on my MacBook Pro, 2.5 GHz Intel Core i7, 8 GB 1333 MHz DDR3, Mountain Lion 10.8.2, Ruby 1.9.3-p327, Redis 2.6.7, redis gem 3.0.2, Redis persistence disabled.</p>

<p>By default, the code will <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard/blob/master/lib/leaderboard.rb#L108-L128">use a Redis transaction to rank a member</a> in the leaderboard. This is to accommodate being able to optionally store data alongside the leaderboard. However, in hindsight, the common case may just be ranking (or updating) a  member in the leaderboard without this data.</p>

<p>Time to insert 10 million records w/ Redis transactions per insert: <strong>23 minutes</strong></p>

<p>It seems like Redis transactions, where they're really not needed, is having a performance impact. I removed the transaction parts of the rank_member method in the library temporarily and re-ran the benchmark code.</p>

<p>Time to insert 10 million records w/o Redis transactions per insert: <strong>13 minutes</strong></p>

<p>This number makes more sense to me and is inline with the original benchmark time of 15 minutes accounting for faster hardware, updated Redis version and updated Redis client library. Awhile back, however, I specifically added a few methods to do <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard/blob/master/lib/leaderboard.rb#L221-L242">bulk insert of member data in a leaderboard</a>. I modified and re-ran the benchmark code to rank members in the leaderboard, 1 million per transaction.</p>

<p>Time to insert 10 million records w/ Redis transaction inserting 1 million records at a time: <strong>7 minutes</strong></p>

<p>When I initially re-ran the benchmark against the leaderboard 3.0.0 code, it felt slower, but I needed actual numbers to backup that feeling. Now I can benchmark the code again if I decide to add in a conditional to not use a Redis transaction in the rank_member method if optional data is not supplied.</p>

The coolest of the cool.</a></h2><div class="blog-author">By <strong>Steven Flenory</strong></div><div class="blog-body"><p>Here at  <a href="http://www.agoragames.com/">Agora Games</a>, we try to do semi-regular Hack-a-thons in the office. Over the last year, we've started trying to do them about once every 2-3 months. This seems to keep them fresh and fun, but still something that doesn't interfere with day to day work needs.</p>

<p>Hackathons have been around since the late 90s, so they've been around for awhile  in the tech field. The idea of a hackathon, as it pertains to Agora, is to give our employees 24 hours to work on anything they want as long as it relates to our business in some way.</p>

<p>Our most recent hackathon took place this past week Thursday 8th - Friday 9th. It started at 4pm on Thursday with a nice kick-off meeting where everyone announced their projects or joined a team as a free agent (if they didn't have their own project).  Everything ended on Friday at 4pm with the demo session. There were a lot of cool projects, but I wanted to point out some of the way cool ones that were showcased.</p>

<p><strong>Gamebattles Match History -  <a href="https://twitter.com/KrussB">Kirk Becker</a></strong></p>

<p>A portion of Agora developers make up the tech arm of Major League Gaming, and a couple of people worked on MLG specific projects. One of these projects focused on adding in a page that displays a user's individual Match History.</p>

<p>This is something that the users of MLG have been asking for, and since we like to please, Kirk is just about ready to release this to the world. In 24 hours, Kirk was able to get a working version of this up on our staging environment. Since this is such a cool product, work will be completed on this in the next couple days, and the users will love it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Podium - <a href="https://twitter.com/CzarneckiD">David Czarnecki</a></strong></p>

<p>David wanted to take this hackathon to explore the use of ProMotion and Formation iOS libraries for application development. Working with these two libraries, He wanted to move to a higher level from hand-writing the interactions in iOS development.</p>

<p>The work done by David is available for review in the following links below. Please note that the iOS coponent requires RubyMotion</p>

<p><strong>Seraph - Brennan Frydl</strong></p>

<p>Brennan made a mini web framework in the spirit of Rails, but running on em-synchrony. This uses tilt for templates, rack-mounts parser for routing, and doesn't make any assumptions about the data/ORM layer! Much like node.js, it handles situations where requests need significant amounts of time. Rather than using CPU, it'll make calls to external web services.</p>

<p>Basic configuration was complete within the 24 hour timeframe, and a nice demo was given which showed the performance improvements when compared to Rails. After looking at the product for another day, it appears as though this is going to be re-written and possibly used in the future here at Agora! Nice!</p>

<p><strong>Notification Bar - <a href="https://twitter.com/jlet">Jack Letourneau</a></strong></p>

<p>Jack created a basic UI for defining time-based notifications using a zoomable/scrollable timeline widget and a WYSIWYG content editor. There was also the creation of a jQuery based widget for popping up notifications onto the top edge of the browser window.</p>

<p>This is something that we've been thinking about doing for our Hydra mobile product, so it was awesome that this was something that got worked on during a hackathon. Development for this item has also continued since the hackathon, which is a beautiful thing.</p>

<p>In all, this was a really successful hackathon for Agora Games. A couple of the projects that were worked on by our engineers are actually going to be utilized in future products across both Major League Gaming and Agora Games. I call that a success!</p>

<p><strong>kairos</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/kairos">kairos</a> provides time-series storage using a Redis backend. The 0.1.0 release integrates the beta-refactor branch. All types of timeseries are created with the Timeseries constructor. The arguments to the constructor have been changed to simplify and clarify their usage. In particular, a single timeseries implements only a single type (e.g. Histogram), read and write functions are shared by all intervals in a timeseries, and the count_only support is now the timeseries type <code>count</code>. Added exceptions. Only exception currently implemented is UnknownInterval.</p>

Well wish no more. Over the next couple of weeks, I'll be putting up posts which outline each individual service that is offered under our Hydra product.</p>

<p>"But <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeJodon">Mike Jodon</a>, I'm a mobile developer, what can I have to read?" Fear not. All of the services that I cover in this series will be, or currently are, being developed for release in our mobile SDKs! So iOS, Android, Unity mobile, you will all eventually have these great tools too! Check out hydra.agoragames.com if you want more information about Hydra mobile, or to sign up for the beta program!</p>

<p>Let's get started!</p>

<p><strong>Profile Service:</strong></p>

<p>The profile service is the most key feature that a game can have for its users. Users love to see their stats for a game that they are playing. They love seeing how they match up against other players, and they love being able to have other players in that game see how good they are doing. A lot of what makes gaming fun (whether it's casual or hardcore), is the element of competition. Whether you're playing Mortal Kombat, Call of Duty, or Farmville, you want your stats to be better than everyone else playing that game.</p>

<p>So what is a profile? How have other clients used the service before, and what else can you do with the service? All of these are answered in this post.</p>

<p>The profile service stores lifetime stats for each user who is online while playing your game. This is where all player specific data will be stored. If your game tracks a stat and stores it within the Hydra profile service, then Hydra can empower you to make other awesome features happen (based on that important profile data). The Profile service helps power a lot of other awesome features, which will also be described below.</p>

<p>So what's usually stored in the Profile for a user? Well that depends what your game is sending, but typically there are some things that we see from almost all titles using Hydra:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic player identifiers, such as their XBL, PSN, Steam name, GFWL name or whatever platform you're using. You'll also find the player name and platform account id if the platform supports that</li>
  <li>Lifetime profile stats, like kills, time played, XP, level/rank, or literally ANY OTHER stat you have in your game</li>
  <li>Load out information, which is something that is specified by the game. Some games have special load outs like "commando" or "ace pilot" or if you're making a racing game, it could save that car load out the player is using.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<p>Again, if it's in your game and it's being sent to hydra, it'll be in that specific player's profile for use by your team. Everything depends on what you game is sending. There's almost limitless possibilities to what the Profile service can do.</p>

<p> 
* * *
 </p>

<p>"Hey Mike, this is all good stuff. What other services can the profile service help power?" Great question! Let's take a look below.</p>

<p>Data from the profile service can be user to power, or help power, the following services, depending on your game structure and data setups:
- Feed Service
- Challenge Service
- Leaderboards
- Statistics Service
- Notifications Service
- Clan Services
- Tournament Service
- User Generated Content
- Global Feed Service
- Inventory Service</p>

<p>Each one of these services will get a write up similar to this one, which will explain exactly what they are and how they've been used in the past. Stay tuned for that!</p>

<p>"Can you give some awesome examples of how the profile service was used in previous titles?" Great question! I'm going to show you a bunch of examples now! Again, EVERYTHING I'm about to show you was built using the Hydra Profile service.</p>

<p> 
* * *</p>

<p><strong>Saints Row: The Third - Released for XBOX360, PS3 and PC</strong>
Saints Row's sandbox style gameplay made it a perfect fit for Hydra integration. Having a game where you could literally play forever and rack up stats, made the profile service a great feature for the community. While playing, you're always getting money, always racking up kills, and always doing something insane. The Profile service here was used to track both single player and multi-player stats. </p>

<p><img alt="" alt="" width="300" height="257" src="/assets/images/uploads/2012/11/Screen-Shot-2012-11-06-at-2.39.47-PM2-300x257-f52ef022.png" /></p>

<p>Saints Row really blew out their profiles on the community website. If there was a stat that a user wanted to see, it was more than likely on their profile. Users were even able to compare their stats to anyone else that was linked to the website, which is a feature that most users want today.</p>

<p>Saints Row also made it so you knew where you stacked up against the rest of the community. They let you know the community average, and which percentile you are in for each stat in the Game Performance center.</p>

<p><strong>Mortal Kombat - Released for XBOX360 and PS3</strong>
 You can't call yourself a gamer if you haven't played Mortal Kombat. Everyone remembers the first arcade machines showing up in their local arcades and video rental stores. In 2011, the latest version of this timeless franchise  was released to the masses with much acclaim. With so many fighters in game, and more released on DLC, it was an honor to have this title's stats being powered by Hydra. </p>

<p><img alt="" alt="" width="300" height="272" src="/assets/images/uploads/2012/11/Screen-Shot-2012-11-12-at-2.23.38-PM1-300x272-5f7592a6.png" /></p>

<p>Mortal Kombat used the profile service to achieve a really granular type of profile for its users. There where stats based on a player's over-all career in the game, as well as stats to show a user's "best" at some key stats.</p>

<p>One of the more granular uses of the stats was to show wins by each character that you as a player have used. They then took that and broke it out by 1 on 1, 2 on 2, and co-op matches. I don't think I've seen this done with any other fighting game's stats, so it was nice to see something so new and detailed.</p>

<p>As you can see, the Profile Service has powered some of the largest titles and franchises in gaming history. If you want to check out some of the other titles we've worked with, check it <a href="http://www.agoragames.com/portfolio/">our portfolio here</a>.  If we can help these games be successes, just imagine what we can do for you!

We are fast approaching our 10th hack-a-thon, so I wanted to take a look back at some of the coolest projects that have come out of our hack-a-thons and share them with the world.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/CzarneckiD">August 31st 2012 - David Czarnecki</a></strong> created an XBLA title in 24 hours! His use of Microsoft's XNA toolkit and APIs was pretty awesome for such a short development time. He actually deployed the game, and we got to demo it in the hack-a-thon wrap-up meeting that afternoon!</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/bradmlafountain">August 31st 2012 - Brad LaFountain</a></strong> worked on word game  that was to be used for internel Hydra tool development! The finished project was fun to play in the wrap-up meeting. This game helped lead to some Hydra Android SDK updates in the match service! Check out this screen shot from the game <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/24388/8q7rasx0xwbw1ac/black.png">Screenshot 1</a> and <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/24388/98vdx0gluv5umv6/bluuuue.png">Screenshot 2</a> . It's nice to note that Brad is continuing his work on this game still, and might even do more during this coming hack-a-thon.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/WashUffize">June 22nd 2012 - Aaron Westendorf</a></strong> worked on a Python library for storing time series data in redis. He worked on simplifying the API so it's easier to integrate, which, as a producer, sounds pretty awesome.</p>

<p><strong>February 25th 2011 - Team Demo:</strong> As Hydra grew as a project, we wanted to see just how easy it was for someone to integrate it into their community website. We found a couple in house engineers who were all front end folks, and whom have never integrated with Hydra before, and told them "You have 24 hrs to do it, let's see what you can do". ** <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeJodon">Mike Jodon</a>** and ** <a href="https://twitter.com/Dragonfist111">Steven Flenory</a>** provided some PSDs that we made in about 3 days, and the web engineers were given developer level access to hydra, that's it, then we told them to get going. In 24 hours, these 2 engineers managed to get up a page with functioning registration, leaderboards, profiles, and a community game powered by our statistics service.</p>

<p>So, what kind of project would you work on if you had 24hrs to work on anything you wanted? What kind of technology would you use?</p>

<p>Check out the other open source projects that Agora Games has worked on, and maybe use them as inspiration :)  <a href="http://github.com/agoragames">http://github.com/agoragames</a></p>

<p>Let us know what you would work on in the comments!</p>

<p> </p>
</div></div></div><div class="blog-entry"><div class="date-comments"><div class="date">Nov 6</div></div><div class="blog-content"><h2><a href="/blog/2012/11/06/saints-row-the-third-launches-goty-edition-where-agora-fits-in/">Saints Row: The Third launches GOTY Edition - Where Agora fits in</a></h2><div class="blog-author">By <strong>Mike Jodon</strong></div><div class="blog-body"><p>Agora Games is proud to have had our Hydra product be a part of <a href="http://www.saintsrow.com/">Saint Row: The Third</a>. With the launch of the Game of The Year edition today in North America (the rest of the world gets it on Nov. 16th), I wanted to run down some of the real cool things that Hydra was used for to help make this title a huge success! Keep in mind that there are a lot more services being used by SR3, but I thought these were a few of the coolest!</p>

<p><strong>Profiles</strong></p>

<p>Utilizing our profile service, the web team was able to put together an awesome user experience for the fans.  We made it possible for a user to create an account in game, then go right to the community website and login with those credentials.  On the <a href="http://www.saintsrow.com/community">SR3 community website</a> users were able to check out their stats and see how they stacked up against the rest of the world. Profiles are used to track a player's lifetime stats and many other essential player data points (game progress, achievements unlocked, etc). So anytime you're signed in online, and play SR3, your profile is being tracked by Agora Games!</p>

<p>Check out these screen shots of the SR3 user profile page! <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/22229/rfn0a7avwm85dgl/Screen%20Shot%202012-11-06%20at%202.39.13%20PM.png">Profile Pic 1</a> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/24388/5oat09clo0nnxw8/Screen%20Shot%202012-11-06%20at%202.39.47%20PM.png">Profile Pic 2</a></p>

<p>As you can see, there is a ton of data being tracked on a per player basis. Everything from total kills, money earned, missions complete and hundreds other. Almost every stat has a "Community Average" where it shows how you stack up against the community as a whole. In Profile Pic 2, you can even see that you can compare your stats to anyone in the community!</p>

<p><strong>Leaderboards</strong></p>

<p>Leaderboards are one of the most utilized Hydra services. While first party integration does have SOME leaderboards, they are limited to 1st party restrictions. Agora gives you the chance to really blow out your game's leaderboards. Any stat you have in game, we can make it into a leaderboard. Want to combine stats to make multi-value leaderboards? We'll do that too. We can even make a leaderboard that shows how many kills players got on a Tuesday with a handgun while in a car, and then tell you which was their favorite car while doing it! If it's in your game data, we'll provide the magic.</p>

<p>Here is an example of what Saints Row did with <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/24388/idi0lh4k461vok3/Screen%20Shot%202012-11-06%20at%203.16.00%20PM.png">their leaderboards. </a> As you can see, this leaderboard is tracking how much cash a user earned, per hour of game play. So we're combining multiple stats to get 1 stat for a totally unique leaderboard. That's some mighty fine calculations there!</p>

<p><strong>User Generated Content</strong></p>

<p>One of the big things that we did with the SR3 title was User Generated Content (or UGC). If you've played the game, and millions of you have (we track that too!), you know that you get to create and customize your own characters to play with in game. But what made this feature truly awesome is, you could <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/22229/8jdre3s0v51nqqq/BigBarbraingame.png">create a character in-game</a>. That character would then get <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9155/22229/cqwficw4tw42z4p/Screen%20Shot%202012-11-06%20at%203.52.34%20PM.png">uploaded to the website,</a> where other users could download it to their console and play with it in their game!</p>

<p>We even helped the Volition team power their Initiation Station pre-launch demo, which allowed users to create in-game characters prior to the actual game launch. Users could then download those characters into the full-title when they picked it up on launch day.</p>

<p><strong>Global Feed Service</strong></p>

<p>One of the other really cool features we did was called the Global Feed Service. We were able to send the website near-realtime data which would populate a map of the the SR3 world (Steelport) with a live feed of what was happening in game. As something interesting happened in game, it popped up on the map on the website as an event.

  <li>blocked_by(id, page_options = default_paging_options, scope = Amico.default_scope_key)</li>

  <li>blocked_by_page_count(id, page_size = Amico.page_size, scope = Amico.default_scope_key)</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the  following methods were added for the pending with relationship:
- pending_with?(id, blocked_by_id, scope = Amico.default_scope_key)
- pending_with(id, page_options = default_paging_options, scope = Amico.default_scope_key)

<p><a href="https://github.com/defunkt/redis-namespace">redis-namespace</a> is a gem which can be used to namespace Redis keys. However, the configuration of the current release's gemspec is incompatible with the 3.0.0 release of the <a href="https://github.com/redis/redis-rb">redis</a> gem. One of our engineers submitted a <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/redis-namespace/pull/39">pull request to test compatibility under the latest redis gem</a> and the current stable and forthcoming release of the Redis server. And hey, it looks like that pull request was integrated and is available in the redis-namespace 1.2.0 release.</p>

<p><strong>vines</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/negativecode/vines">vines</a> is an XMPP chat server for Ruby.

 **</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/czarneckid/coffeescript-streak">coffeescript-streak</a> and <a href="https://github.com/czarneckid/streak">streak</a> both got an update this week. streak was originally developed as a way to collect win/loss streaks using Redis. The update to the libraries this week slightly alters the way the keys are namespaced in Redis. Not a huge change, but one that brings some consistency to how we've namespaced keys in Redis in other libraries.</p>

<p><strong>haigha</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/haigha">haigha</a>, our simple to use client library for interacting with AMQP brokers saw numerous updates this week.

</div></div></div><div class="blog-entry"><div class="date-comments"><div class="date">Apr 27</div></div><div class="blog-content"><h2><a href="/blog/2012/04/27/dont-let-your-community-website-become-a-red-headed-stepchild/">Don't Let Your Community Website Become a Red-headed Stepchild</a></h2><div class="blog-author">By <strong>Mike Jodon</strong></div><div class="blog-body"><p>Each new game project that The Hydra Team at Agora Games works on has us smack dab in the middle of game and web development teams.  Together, these game and web development teams set out to build a game and community website experience that will be very tightly aligned.  We like being in the middle.</p>

<p>Our technology puts us in a unique spot where we integrate directly into the game, and this is when we work directly with the game development teams. A few key examples below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tracking and storing all user profile stats.</li>
  <li>Tracking and storing all user match stats.</li>
  <li>Powering in-game MOTDs.</li>
  <li>Supporting the upload/download of in-game UGC (user generated content).</li>
</ul>

<p>Our technology also puts us in a spot to then help translate those in-game features onto the web, and this is when we work directly with the web development teams.  A few key examples below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Providing the stored game data and APIs to showcase a full user profile.</li>
  <li>Providing the stored game data and APIs to showcase a user's historical match stats.</li>
  <li>Providing APIs for a community team to build web tools so they can push new MOTDs in-game.</li>
  <li>Providing the stored game data and APIs to support a per user UGC queue so that UGC created in-game can be showcased on edited on the web.</li>
</ul>

<p>The nice one-two punch of awesome in-game integration combining with a spiffy community website package is hard to achieve.  We've helped game projects achieve this game-to-web Nirvana on numerous occasions, but a good majority of the time we see the community website fall very short of its original expectations.  We've been on early project marketing calls where a super excited marketing representative lays out an amazing game and community website combination, with all the bells and whistles that "they must have!"  12 months later an awesome game launches, but the community website is a barren wasteland of a basic user profile and community forums.  We've seen this happen too many times.</p>

<p>I'll preface the next section by saying that Agora Games totally understands that the game is king.  The game is 60 bucks a pop, and all in-game integration gets first dibs at all times.  We understand, and we fall in, we like your business.  With that said, it so deeply saddens us to see community websites fall into the red-headed stepchild role, playing second fiddle, and inevitably hitting the cutting room floor [I think I hit the max on cliches in that last sentence].  This doesn't have to happen.  A community website might not get you 60 bucks every time a user signs on, but a strong community website with solid integration into the ever so popular social networks can keep your user-base playing well into the next fiscal year and buying every single piece of DLC you throw at them.  How do we make it work you ask?</p>

<p>We like being in the middle, we've been in the middle, we HAVE seen it work, and we have 3 easy tips!  <strong>Note:</strong> These tips do not require you work with us – we're not that sneaky.</p>

<p><strong>1.) Don't leave so fast Mr. Marketing</strong> - That same super excited marketing guy that I mentioned above tends to disappear fast.  He/she usually has a really awesome dream scenario of what a game and its community website equivalent should look like, they speak the hell out of it at the beginning of a project, but then they fade out of regular communication with that plan shortly after.  Weekly calls get setup with the engineering team.  Weekly calls get setup with the web team.  Mr. Marketing tends to not show up at either.  This means that the already tight engineering resources and deadlines pummel community website features in the face, slowly knocking them off one-by-one because all in-game features must be there on launch day.  If there was a marketing presence checking in more often throughout the lifetime of the project, there would be many less angry marketing people that cry when they sign onto the community website on launch night (only to see community forums and a "community profile coming soon" message).</p>

<p><strong>2.) Community Managers are smart, let them play early and often</strong> - As I mentioned above, marketing folks tend to have 15 other projects to move onto right after they give their game and community website speech at the beginning of a project.  Since they can't make it to bi-weekly and weekly tech calls as actual development picks up, they should send someone in their place.  Community Managers can fill this role!  Send at least one voice to all weekly calls that fights and reminds the team of that original game and community website plan.  If a community manager can hear there is the possibility that things might get cut (because of deadlines and resources), they can at least go back and report these facts so the top community website features can be re-prioritized and fought for on next week's call.  The best community features WILL actually launch if there is a voice to fight for them.</p>

<p><strong>3.) Don't be afraid to let game developers and web developers mix</strong> - Too often game developers want nothing to do with web developers, and web developers don't particularly enjoy developing a community website if they're dealing with half-assed game code on features that we're deemed as "they can be cut if we don't get to them community website features."  It's almost going to sound too easy, but get a web developer presence on weekly tech calls as early as possible!  Don't force producers to waste time and run two different calls (a weekly game tech call and a weekly web tech call) when they can be easily joined into one.  Get both game and web developers on a weekly call, have a precise agenda that you follow each and every week, and hit the ground running.  Game and web developers will actually know each other, like each other, and will ultimately make Mr. Marketing very happy.  As a third party producer I will now purposely force my will upon the game projects our Agora team works on, because I am so passionate about this particular tip.  We'll run the weekly tech and web calls for you, we'll send out the precise agendas, and we'll keep the communication between all teams open very early on for you.  We do it first and foremost because it helps our development get done on time, but it also makes YOUR game and community website projects successful!</p>

<p><strong>This is what happens when these tips aren't used (I purposely left this in a "ramble-on" format):</strong> Marketing folks disappear, no community voice is on weekly calls, game development teams dig in (concentrating on their in-game features first and foremost), time goes along and things get built – with no one reminding the teams of community website needs on the weekly calls (we bring community needs up the best we can, but ultimately we can only push when a web team has priorities), the web development team gets brought into the fold months later (too late usually), they look at the list of features they should be building onto the community website (handed to the them from Mr. Marketing), they ask the game development team whats ready to go, and the game development team says, "uhhhhhhhhh, not a whole lot,  but you do have a user profile!"  This leads to additional community website feature cuts after the web development team is left scrambling having to re-prioritize the small set of community features they actually can build, wasting time not getting to the actual web development itself.  We've seen it happen too often.</p>

<p>In conclusion, if you're reading this, we want you to take our tips because in-game and community website integration is something we ALL need to see improving on a regular basis – we all need our jobs after all.</p>

<p>Remember the <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/vindicia-api">vindicia-api</a> gem from a few weeks ago that we open sourced? One of our ex-interns, Steven Davidovitz, developed a Vindicia Payment Gateway for the active_merchant gem. Check out his <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/active_merchant/pull/332">pull request that adds this functionality</a>.</p>

<p><strong>brewscribe</strong></p>

<p>The 0.2.0 release of the brewscribe gem this week adds a number of new classes: Mash, Carbonation, Equipment and Style as well as being able to parse Style listings and Recipe now following the type conversion system. If you use Ruby and Beersmith2, you should be involved with this project.</p>

<p><strong>constant-redefinition</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/czarneckid/constant-redefinition">constant-redefinition</a> had its first functional changes in over a year. You can now pass a block when defining or re-defining constants to have them unset or reset to their original value.</p>

<p><strong>kairos</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/agoragames/kairos">Kairos</a> is a new Python library for performing time-series data storage in Redis. Kairos is intended to replace RRD in situations where the scale of Redis is required, with as few dependencies on other packages as possible. It should work with <a href="http://www.gevent.org/">gevent</a> out of the box.</p>

<p><strong>constant-redefinition</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/czarneckid/constant-redefinition">constant-redefinition</a> Ruby gem allows you to define constants if not defined on an object (or Module) and redefine constants without warning. You might use this when you've got large limits defined as constants in an application that you want to change under test so that you can still test edge cases, but with a smaller limit so that your test suite runs faster. Its test suite was converted from Test::Unit to RSpec.</p>

<p>We do a fair amount with AMQP in our middleware product and so we have written <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/haigha">haigha</a>, a AMQP libevent client in Python. 0.4.2 and 0.4.3 were released this week.

We've got 2 darksky-related releases this week. darksky continues to expand their <a href="http://darkskyapp.com/api/">API</a> and they added two new endpoints: "brief_forecast" and "interesting". The 1.0.4 release of the <a href="https://github.com/czarneckid/darksky">darksky</a> gem adds support for the "brief_forecast" endpoint. The "interesting" endpoint was supported as of the 1.0.3 release.</p>

A ruby gem that integrates with the Vincidia CashBox SOAP API doesn't do the development community any good if it's hidden away. So one of our engineers, Tom Quackenbush, polished off some rough edges and released version 0.0.2 of the <a href="https://github.com/agoragames/vindicia-api">vindicia-api</a> gem.</p>

This releases addresses the first future idea from the README when the gem was released over a year ago to add a method allowing for bulk insert of data into a leaderboard. Performance of the bulk insert indicates this is preferable to individual inserts if you ever need to insert a large amount of data into a leaderboard.</p>

<p>We have a number of pull requests that we need to get integrated into various projects.

</div></div></div><div class="blog-entry"><div class="date-comments"><div class="date">Feb 6</div></div><div class="blog-content"><h2><a href="/blog/2012/02/06/techvalley-startup-weekend/">TechValley Startup Weekend</a></h2><div class="blog-author">By <strong>Brian Corrigan</strong></div><div class="blog-body"><p>On March 3, 2012 <a href="http://startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a> comes to TechValley. Startup Weekend is a technology focused business competition, where people pitch ideas, form ad-hoc teams, and develop a product idea over the span of a weekend. Despite what a lot of people think, it's not a code competition in the spirit of the <a href="http://nodeknockout.com/">Node Knockout</a> or <a href="http://archive.railsrumble.com/">Rails Rumble</a>; points aren't awarded based on cool tech alone. However, also unlike these other events, Startup Weekend focuses on producing real-life companies with making real money. (Like, for real, yo). Why should you care?</p>

<p><strong>As a resident of the Capital Region, it's good for our economy</strong>
 There are almost a dozen out of town Venture Capitalists, executives, and engineers travelling here to learn more about what we have to offer. This area has become increasing important due to our local engineering talent and our vicinity to both NYC and Boston. Startup Weekend is the perfect time to show off our entrepreneurial and technical prowess. It's my belief that while this region has all the right raw materials, it needs a grassroots spark to fan the flames.</p>

<p><strong>As a business owner or manager, it's good for your company</strong>
 Startup Weekend is a great way to let your company and your team think outside the bounds &amp; constraints they work with during the week. It's also a great way to meet other local talent and test your wits against other people in the area. I promise you'll be surprised at all the small startups that exist right here under your nose. Finally, it shows your team, your customers, and your colleagues that you care about their field and our region. Win win!</p>

<p><strong>As a software craftsperson, it's good for your career</strong>
 No one stays in one place forever (particularly in our field). The opportunities locally aren't as abundant as they might be in a larger metropolitan area,but that itself creates a unique opportunity. Great startups (like all great teams) require the right mix of people. It's exceedingly rare to see a single individual take an idea and develop it into something meaningful on their own. Said another way, its more risky (resulting in a smaller potentially upside) to go it alone. At Startup Weekend you'll meet scores of other people interested in the business of technology. Who knows, maybe that idea you've had kicking around will take root and grow.</p>

<p>Agora is encouraging (and helping to subsidize) attendance by any interested employees. Here's a list of other businesses sponsoring the event (current, as I write this post):</p>
